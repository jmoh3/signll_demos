    "My absolute favorite Thai food EVER! I've been coming here for year! I now live in Chicago but every time I'm down in Champaign I insist on Bangkok Thai. Their chicken red curry is the best I've ever had! I've had Thai in every major city in the country and this has yet to be beat.",
    "I stopped in for a quick dinner with some friends.  I ordered the chicken pad thai and had crab rangoon for an appetizer.  I like how you can request the different level of spice. I chose level 4, but wish I went spicier!  I thought the food was very good, cheap, quick, and convenient.  I would definitely be back!",
    "Very good price, large portions size, and they are very quick to prepare your order.  Not a fancy restaurant but good for a quick lunch.  The food is very good and you can choose how spicy you want your food.",
    "Tried yellow curry and basil chicken. Both are too overcooked. Chicken are too chewy. The meals are not as amazing as others said. disappointment",

The menu is so inviting, I'm making a reservation for May and taking a friend for her birthday, so we can try more of the wonderful offerings. Our server was delightful and efficient. She easily answered every question and always came to the table with a friendly smile and attitude. The only reason I did not give Arcadia a 5-star rating, is that the tables for two are too small, too small for the healthy array of food that two people order!","4691":"Delicious sushi, very classy, slightly expensive (depending on the size of your belly), good for dates :)","5721":"Awesome price, came here for our anniversary, got a discount, great room, always clean, inside the hotel is he most amazing bakery and garden.. MUST SEE. Close to everything, watch fountains outside your window. Free parking and great scurity. LOVED IT!!!","4543":"We were staying not far away. So we were happy to find a vegan pizza place that used Daiya","8817":"One of the coolest bar off strip. Gothic and noir theme. Drinks were pretty reasonable.  Pretty good after-hours.  The lobby is awesome, Great for hanging out with your friends.","5182":"In spite of reading very bad reviews of this company on yelp I decided to rely on Zillow's reviews and go through with Roundpoint. I worked with Christopher Kinson. Days 1 to 7 he was very responsive, very professional, and seemed to really know what he was doing. I told him that my closing date could not be past the two month mark because I had to travel for an extended period of time. He assured it it would get done. After the first couple of days I had uploaded all the docs they needed to their website. From that point onwards I didn't hear anything for weeks and weeks. When I emailed Christopher he told me that they had dropped the ball but that we would still make it on time. What really ticked me off is that before admitting that it was their fault, he tried to blame the delays on me - very very shady tactics and I called him out on it. Eventually I was approved but it did not close in time. Chris didn't even bother to give me a call once during this entire process, not even when I told them I wanted to cancel the application. I sometimes wonder if this company is a scam. They just get you to pay for the appraisal then just drop you like a fly. Very unprofessional and unresponsive. They really had no intention of ever finishing on time, yet they made me delay my travel 4 days and felt no remorse whatsoever. One thing I learned from this experience is to trust my gut. They felt shady, and they were...","6808":"So glad we followed Yelp reviews and chose this Mexican fast food place when we were passing thru yesterday at lunch time.  We (husband, adult daughter, and I) call ourselves taco inspectors....love to sample street style tacos whenever we get a chance.  Santa Rosas carne asada and carnitas tacos were excellent.  Wished we could have tried other offerings.  I like the little salsa bar, nice to be able to help ourselves.  Very efficient and friendly staff.  Would return often if only we lived nearby.  Highly recommend.","1200":"The people that work here are dumber than a bag full of hammers....handed them their own frequent buyer stamp card after purchasing ten drinks on prior visits and between four employees they couldn't figure out what kind of discount to provide me on which size drink despite the fact that it says free 16 ounce drink right on the card!! Another fine example of solid public education in Charlotte! Know what you want and pay in exact change because chances are pretty good that the person working the register will be too stupid to figure out the change to provide you...","6149":"The go to food here will always be the KFC (Korean style Fried Chicken) along with some corn cheese! So good! Jin was a wonderful waitress! Service with a smile!","958":"Tommy N is the shiznit! I miss this guy. I moved to Chicago and now I am without of one of the best hair stylist I have ever had. This guy charges $25 for what Toni and Guy charge. Tommy should be charging a lot more for his service because he is very busy and you have to schedule about 2 weeks in advance to get a cut with him.\n\nTommy is awesome because he makes conversation with you during your cut and doesn't just do his job and send you on his way. He listens, pays attention and actually knows whats going on with you.\n\nTwo thumbs up for this Salon having such a Great guy","6919":"This place has a sweet homemade feel. We had the 15 shrimp and pork dumplings for under $10. Pretty reasonable. They were simple, flavourful and delicious! No special sides or garnish, that stuffs not needed here :)","4733":"We have been to SDG about 5 times now and have found the food & service to be very good.  I'm not going to do as some of the others and comment on the rest of the patrons, what do they have to do with the QUALITY of the FOOD or the SERVICE?\nMy steaks have always been good, the portions large, and the server has seemed \ngenuinely concerned that I was happy.  Also, why would I visit a place several times\nand then decide it's a disappointment?  If I keep going back, obviously I believe it to be good.  \n  A few pointers: If you can't take animal heads up on the wall, don't go.\n  You probably don't want to take an overly sensitive vegetarian to Steve's.\n  Don't eat half of your dinner and then complain that it's not done right.\n  If you don't like waiting, don't wait and then complain that you had to.\n\nGo with a light heart, people you love, and enjoy the food & atmosphere.","5780":"LOVE MY SMILE!  Dr. Denisovich is a professional dedicated to excellence in dentistry.  Dr. D is a very caring dentist. Throughout the whole process, he explained the steps that were taken and always showed great concern for my dental health. I was very conscious of my teeth for the longest time I didn't want to smile. After extensive work done by Dr. D I feel very confident to smile without feeling insecure. There is not enough words to explain how thankful I am beyond any measures for my beautiful smile. I would highly recommend Dr. D to everyone!\n\nLily","4145":"Amazing sashimi! The rock shrimp and spicy chicken are amazing as well. Everything is great here and they have a lot of different choices.","6299":"Quality, upscale barbershop with neighborhood prices in the heart of the newly updated Downtown. All barbers are equally talented, with a combined total of 25 years of experience. Come and experience a REAL barbershop with REAL barbers. No Bullshit, just great haircuts.","6690":"The first line of your response says that you suggested that I DO NOT get it replaced, but continue using it. In the very next line, you say that the phone was unusable. What does that tell me about your credibility??\n\nWhile I respect your advice, you need to realize that it is my phone and my money, so once I decide to get it replaced, all YOU as a person who repairs it need to tell me is whether you are competent enough to get it done in a professionally acceptable manner. You were not doing me any favors by getting it fixed at the agreed price. I was PAYING YOU. And the $10 deal on Yelp is part of the price you advertised. So that was no discount!! Once you agreed to get it fixed, you needed to play by the rules, which you clearly did not!! You put on a wrong screen and most importantly you did not take care of my phone which I entrusted you with.\n\nLet me tell you why I'm not accepting your offer to get the case replaced. How would you feel if some guy took your phone, scraped and scratched the casing and then offered to fix it if you were willing to pay for it. You took a perfectly fine phone (except for the hairline crack) and scraped and scratched the heck out out of it. And now you're trying to get more business from me?? You try to put the blame on me saying the phone was useless after the fall. You don't even know what happened to the phone and yet you make seemingly credible remarks. Bringing it once to you was a mistake. Your same incompetent technician is still going to fix this phone if I ever return and I'd never let him repair another phone of mine. This is the same reason why I did not take the offer to get my old screen back on, cos I could not imagine what ELSE he would end up doing to my phone while he took off the current screen and put on the old one. \n\nAnd finally, a word to you. You run this place. And yet, not once but TWICE you delivered a product to a customer which was WAY below the standard of a deliverable. If you really took pride in your business, you'd have reviewed your technician's work and got him to do quality work BEFORE a product was delivered to the customer. Both the times, when you handed over the phone to me, you seemed to have barely taken a glance at the condition in which my phone was being returned to me, which as a customer is something that I cannot digest. When you told me  I don't know, my technician did it, you lost my trust as a customer. \n\nI'm done doing business with you!","1156":"Seems like this place has gone down hill, a lot.  Ordered steak medium, it arrived a few degrees shy of rare, they were out of the wine we wanted, pasta was over cooked and stuck together, didn't bother to re-fill sodas once during dinner.","2206":"I got really lost looking for this place! Directionally challenged I know. But my excuse is that I'm an international traveler in your fine city!\n\nAnyway, I was starving and was determined to find this joint after reading all these great reviews. I had the 1\/4 chicken leg combo, which was translated to me by a really nice couple (the menu is in French FYI). I watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a TON of fries!!! The meal could easily feed a family of four! It also comes with rice and a salad. But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!\n\nThe chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be. And everything was a teensy bit too salty. If I had a friend to share it with, it would have been more manageable!  All in all a great neighborhood restaurant. Seems to be hugely popular with the locals. The line was almost out the door!","3750":"Beautiful space! Great work! I'm very happy I gave it a try! I'll definitely be back.","270":"One of my go to place for dining out. You won't regret eating here. I have tasted almost every dish and almost all were good.","4878":"POOR SERVICE !!!\n\nThe first time I eat there the service was slow (one waitress who tried her best) but I wanted to give the them benefit of a doubt. We waited 35 minutes for the main course.  I came home and had a VERY BAD stomach ache.  In my opinion the meat was NOT fresh.  I eat meat on a regular basis and being from the middle-east I am used to it.  So I went there the second time and order a FELAFEL SANDWICH. Not only did it take LONG TIME to get the sandwich, it looked NOT FRESH. I barely touched it. \n\nTo make matters worse, the waitress didn't even care that I barely touched my plate and presented me with a $15.62 check.  WHAT A JOKE !!!!  \n\nI DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT TO ME, ITS ONE THING IF THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMER NOT EATING THEIR FOOD, YET QUITE ANOTHER TO CHARGE THEM FOR IT..!!!!  EAAKKKKKK!!!","5415":"There is no better shawarma in the city. They add the perfect ingredients - nothing too obscure, but still enough flavour. It doesn't take much to order - they just grab your name and off you go. It's not too greasy, full of flavour, and though it's a little messy - it is quite the satisfying meal. \n\nI crave Jimmy's. I tell everyone to go there, it's simply fantastic.","6746":"We went to this place because I saw a used vehicle that I really liked and we were looking to get my payment down. Once inside it took 30 minutes to just talk to a sales person. Then he was a waste of time. He looked my car up on Kelly blue book and gave us a price that blew me away in a bad away. He said something about how they buy cars in bulk and then sell them but tells me they will give me 4,000$ less then the same car they are selling on their lot with more miles. The vibe we got was they had no time for us.","3731":"Excellent massage excellent service\nI would highly recommend \nAsk for 1 hour table shower \nGreat deal.","6106":"We recently moved to Fountain Hills and have been here four or five times.  Here are our favorites.  The flatbread\/pizzas.  They are exceptional; thin crispy crust and always with fresh stuff on top.  If they have a special pizza, I would order it.  The Gattopardo with arugula\/prosciutto was the closest thing to the pizza we loved in Italy.  My mouth is still watering over the Chicken Piccata.  My husband had the marsala and that was great too.  The calamari is fun if you have a group.  \n\nWe like to go and have a glass of wine, salads and share a flatbread.  That is plenty for us.  Other people reviewed that the portions were small, I would say the portions are normal and for the price, I think fine.   It is nicely family run, with good service but not smothering. Maria works the front of the house.  Her husband works the wood fired pizza oven.  By the third time we were there, they welcomed us like we were family.","9058":"So amazing. I recommend #4. The atmosphere is not cozy but the food is so good and so affordable. The staff is friendly.","40":"The signage and shop is cute but this operation is run by satan herself. She does not pay her employees. I know of three so far. She has terrible people skills, just read the reviews. I don't know how she is still in business.  Chances are she wont be for long, but please do not spend your money in this shop.  Find a cake shop that deserves your business.","8192":"Good place to grab drinks.  Decent food.  Nice space.\n\nWent around 6:30pm on a Wednesday night a was seated right away.  Seems like it would be a great place for groups.  Really casual, but more on the trendy side.\n\nThere's about 100 options of beers to choose from, and I started with their house-brewed IPH, which was their version of IPA and not super hoppy, but a littttle on the sour side.\n\nMost of our group ordered burgers.  I wouldn't say they are the best burgers I ever had.  I'd give it a 6\/10.  Nothing special, but definitely not bad.  \n\nMain compliant I have is that my fiance ordered his burger medium rare, but his was definitely more medium\/well done.  Mine was ordered medium, but came out a little more medium rare.  We ordered different types of burgers, so this definitely was a mixup.  \n\nI also ordered the Truffle Fries, which were yummy.  How can you go wrong with Truffle Anything!!  The fries are slightly thicker cut, but not wedge style fries and were cooked really well.  I didn't love the cheese crumbles that were on top of it though.  So I'd give the fries 7\/10.  \n\nI also ordered the Carnegie Cucumber and it was the highlight of the meal for me!  I always love a well made cocktail.  Simple, crisp and strong.  Seemed a little pricey to me, more like LA-pricing to me, but you definitely get a LARGE glass, so it's definitely worth it!  I really want to go back and try their other cocktails!","9078":"Yay! A crepe place in Kensington! I had a dessert crepe and it was good. Nothing too fancy. I'm excited to try a savoury crepe. It takes a little while for the crepe to be made, so be prepared to wait if there are already a lot of people in there. They wrap them up so you can walk around with one, but the paper they use is a little tough and awkward to unwrap.","4345":"Very good restaurant! Calamari with kimchee was exceptional!  Lamb sliders and stuffed dates also delicious!! The only star lost was on service. We had reservation for 730. We arrived at 705. It did not look busy and there were open tables; however, we did not get a text for seating until 750! We opted for the bar, and after that, we were golden!!!","1062":"Will be back. Service was great. Assisted in helping with colors.  Open early, which I love!  Very personable.","5948":"stop by and tast best chicken wings i ever had mmmmm !!!!!!","4166":"I've been coming to Mama's since they opened. Wonderful service, coffee blends and pastries. Even met my Soulmate here 2.22.14","1173":"NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE!\n\n The worst experience ever!!! Once we got there we had been lead to the fast line, I was feeling pretty lucky at that moment! BUT the thing what happened next, makes me feel really BAD about this shitty club!!\n\nFirst, one security checked my ID. He couldn't believe the photo is mine, and I'm actually 21! He turned my ID to another security, which also checked it for several times, and asked me sign on a piece of paper for 3 times!!! And they still don't believe it, then the SUPERVISOR showed up, who was a TOTALLY ASSHOLE! I showed the supervisor my student ID, my credit cards and my passport. 4 documents, 3 pictures, and 3 signatures. HE STILL KEPT SAYING THAT I WAS USING AN FAKE ID! I asked him do I look like someone who make fake ID and credit card? He said Yes!!!!! This made me believe that he was being racist because I'm Chinese! Then he suddenly become angry, like I said he is a racist person actually offences him!!! OMG! Then he told me I feel free to leave, nobody asks me to stay here!!  Me and my friends just left at the end!\n\nI still can't believe this actually happened tonight. I've never be so humiliated in my life! I showed him bunch of IDs, and he just kept being an ASSHOLE!","967":"I loved this place for one reason only. It reminded me of all the divey Latin American places I've eaten at while abroad: Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala, etc.  The food was good and decently priced and the ambience was totally authentic: dirty, tiny, black and white TV, flies buzzing around.... Great place.","7515":"Stopped at Matta's for a business dinner. There were lots of choices but I went with the Spanish ribeye.  It was served with rice and beans and a large flour tortilla. Service was ok but the food was excellent. Will definitely visit again.","8418":"Do I have to give them 1 star you all should consider this a negative star.Absolutely the worst fast food service I've ever experienced.Every order I've gotten has been in some way or the other wrong.i check every order but I'm not opening boxes n unwrapping sandwiches.Today I ordered an egg n cheese Mc muffin got em home n they put ham on em.the worst one was couple of months back they had those wings n I ordered them n sat at window for 7 min been in line for 10 then Mgr asks me to pull up to wait in s designated space .I'm just sitting there before I realize I've been there another 10 min and there are no cars in line. I drove over to front door went in an there's the Mgr sitting at a dinning room table eating.i asked her where my food was that I've been waiting for 15 minutes outside.i was so mad I just took my food n left.2 months later stupid me went back for another screw up.Buy the way this Mgr is on duty 90 percent of time I go there.I was a Mgr for 20 years in fast food n sit down I wouldn't hire this lady as a cashier","1424":"Went thru drive thru ordered the #3 Western Bacon Cheeseburger Combo,\nUpsell is something they don't lack on. From  upsizing to adding a cookie.\nFries were nice and hot but the burger lacked presentation. Looked like it had been smashed down to fit in the bag.\nTaste was where it should be. Service is spot on.","1519":"Recommended Dish: Tue\/Thur 1\/2 price wings special\n\nReviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time\nService Speed: 1 \/ 5\nCooking speed: 1 \/ 5\nFood Quality: 4 \/ 5\nFood Quantity: 4 \/ 5\nPrice: 3.5 \/ 5 \nCleanness: 3.5 \/ 5 \nRepeat: Only if you like wings and don't mind slow service.\n\nProbably one of the cheapest place for wings downtown. 2 Lb of wings will run you $12-13. But you have to a drink for around $3 with the wings special. They nickel and dime you for everything, $1 for the fries, $1 for the veggies....\nMake sure you order before noon, because the service \/ cooking speed is extremely slow. \nIf you have willing to put up with slow service, the wings are juicy and quite good.","607":"I have been coming here for lunch on weekdays for years now and the service is always what keeps me coming back, not to mention the Italian dishes are all very good.  On a side not, I also love that they separate the smoking section off so you are not dining in a restaurant full of smoke (like in most other sports bar\/grills).  \nThe salads are all very good choices especially the antipasto salad.  And did I mention portion sizes... they are huge so I almost always end up taking some home for a quick dinner later on.  Enjoy!","4375":"I heard everyone rave about BMG so I was really excited to go. Only it was very diapointing, I don't pay to see people eat and  then in a form throw it up. The sense with the machinary were my favorite. Even though I did expect to see more of the bluemen performing.","5562":"I love this restaurant.  Love the atmosphere and the food.  My only complaint is they use bleach to clean, and I can always smell it when I arrive.","5163":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Didn't eat here but witnessed the owner chastise an upset patron who was rightfully upset. He embarrassed her and demeaned her in front of his other patrons. Unapologetic for his errors and then on top to humiliate the customer? Unacceptable.","200":"Used to be a fan. Now not so much. Servers turn over way too fast now. Service inconsistent and some of the new staff way too timid to make it a relaxed environment. I've been here at least 40 times and it's not quite the same anymore.","6401":"These guys are awesome! Fast and cheap. I'm out of state and was concerned about finding a company to help me. But after finding Cool Aid on yelp I contacted them and it was a great choice.","1489":"For the price, very reasonable... I laughed, I was entertained and I had fun!!! xxx","4111":"A nice place to go drinking in the evening with a decent atmosphere but not a place to visit for a meal, standard pub fair with little imagination or skill.","3114":"Delicious thai food at half the cost as other restaurants. Service is fast and friendly and the area isn't awful but seating is limited. Usually you can sit right down because there take out option is so popular. They also had an amazing duck curry (a favorite dish of mine) but took it off the menu because the price of duck was too expensive to offer the dish cheaply. But keep checkin to see if they bring it back cuz its worth it!","3340":"Great tacos and especially salsas in a somewhat crowded small shop on 16th st. Maybe the best part of the experience is loading up on the salsas from the salsa bar and going to town on warm chips. (My favorite is the peanut salsa). \n\nThey are also really are proud of the chocolate mole which is very unique and something I have not seen at other shops. They mole is great, very flavorful, but also very intense, so make sure you want a hardy meal before ordering a dish with it! Parking can be tight, especially if you come during the lunch hour as there are only a handful of spots outside the building.","1782":"Best steak in Madison! It has a great family atmosphere and also has great food. The portions are big and the staff is very friendly. It has a old rustic feel to it. The filet mignon is great and so are the hash-browns!","518":"I love this place. The food is healthy....i wish you have brown rice to go with veggie kebab.","297":"Was here in March with some colleagues for an early dinner and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere! \n\nThe decor is very cool, Korean\/Mexican\/hipster which should be my nightmare but I dug it. \n\nWe shared kalbi ribs and guacamole to start and I think they're both must-orders. The kalbi ribs were deliciously tender and had a nice Korean bbq marinade (sweet, salty, tangy). The guac didn't last long, chips were a bit overly salted but actually when paired with the guac it was balanced. \n\nFor tacos I had 1 crispy taco with braised short rib, and 1 baja fish. I loved both of them, but would probably pick the short rib over the baja fish next time even though it was quite messy. The shell didn't crumble as much as your old el paso would and the short rib jus had some deep flavour. Two of my colleagues had a crispy chicken taco and I was admittedly jealous - it will be ordered next time, they raved about it and it seemed to be a popular pick on other tables at the restaurant.\n\nI found the service to be lacking, our waitress was hard to get a hold of and we waited quite awhile for drink orders to be taken and delivered once we had arrived (it was a pretty mean margarita though - not lacking on the tequila). \n\nWorth a visit if you like playa cabana!","8823":"Glad I tried it!\n\nI had an extremely negative experience at the Biltmore location that I was hesitant to try this location but so glAd that I did!\n\nDelicious food and good service!","2319":"I had an awesome experience at Becker's.  The store has a great selection of dresses and prices.  My budget is $1,000 which is a little challenging.  I found it difficult to stick to my budget at a few other stores I have visited.  At Becker's I had many beautiful dresses within my budget.  To top it all, my my consultant, Eliza, was everything you can ask for.  She was knowledgeable, friendly, professional, funny and patient.  I ended up loving one of the dresses she picked out for me.  At the end of my appointment I found out that the staff at Becker's are not on commission.  Eliza was very helpful in finding me the perfect dress but she was not pushy when she knew I was not 100% sure.  I have one more appointment at Felicia Bridal but I am almost positive I will get this dress from Becker's.  I highly recommend any bride-to-be to visit this store.  I was very stressed and disappointed with the selection of dresses and prices at the other bridal stores I have visited.  My experience at Becker's got me excited about my wedding.  A big thank you to Becker's and my consultant, Eliza.","183":"Almost impossible to have anyone call back from this dealership. Countless calls and messages have been left with the Service Manager Ilene Brooks. No call back. They pushed me off to Corp Infiniti. They informed me that the request has nothing to do with them and that is is actually the dealerships responsibility after putting a non sanctioned part in my car and causing catastrophic engine damage. I I have called for the GM Sanjay (sp). Apparently he doesn't have an extension or an office. I find that hard to believe that the GM of the location has no where to conduct business matters.  This is not the experience that i expect when dealing with a superior brand.","5116":"Excellent customer service!  I am brand new to MAC and as soon as I walked in I was greeted and helped.  Tera did an amazing job showing me techniques of applying makeup and she did it in a way where I feel, with a little practice of course, that I can re-create the same look.","530":"This is a great boutique in North Scottsdale.  Ruby has such cute dresses to go out in and is a little jewel box inside of this shopping center.  As the two other reviews said they carry great brands like the established Tibi or even new brands.  One  that I saw and loved from Phoenix Fashion Week was Smoke & Mirrors Clothing from Los Angeles.  Ruby carries a lot of what I saw and loved on the runway.  Ruby is always getting new stuff in so it's a great place to check in with anytime you need a dress or a kick start to your newest fashion routine. Two thumbs up!","5963":"Can I get a Whopper? Not anymore...\n\nA former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.\n\nInside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...\n\nThis restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.\n\nWith that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.\n\nWell to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.\n\nA variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a souffl\u00e9 of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.\n\nOne benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.\n\nQuite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.","7767":"Woke up craving a not on the strip breakfast and found this fast food taco shop down the road from my hotel. Pretty basic but the chorizo and eggs (#9) hit the spot. Clean and friendly counter help","5860":"Great barbeque, variety of sauces, super tasty specials, superb rotating beers.  You must try the cornbread...it has bbq meat in it!  My fave is the tacos with pork and chipotle sauce.","5371":"EAT HERE. NOW!! Definitely the best (and freshest) Mexican food I've ever had. Coming from San Diego (where taco shops are plentiful) my fianc\u00e9 and I were eager to find some yummy Mexican food. Needless to say, we did. Prices are SUPER reasonable - my fianc\u00e9 and I shared a chicken salad and two frescas for $12 and change. The chicken salad is enough to share, and the drinks tasted super fresh. I got a spinach and pineapple one and my fianc\u00e9 got a strawberry mango. Great service and beautiful interior as well! We'll definitely be back :)","4837":"Not recommended.  Our ride from the airport to the Tropicana Hotel on van 692 on 3\/22 was miserable.  It took twice as long as they said to arrive at the airport, then we sat there for 10 minutes with a full van waiting for one more person.  After we left the driver went back around to the airport to pick up someone else.  He never said anything about what he was doing and the people on board were getting restless and frustrated.  He said we were the second dropoff.  After we dropped someone at the MGM, he went to Hooters instead of the Tropicana.  That didn't make sense because of the locations so I asked the driver and he yelled at me.  The entire van full of people were getting angry with this obnoxious driver and poor service.","4797":"We dined at Sonata's Saturday night for the first time , it had been recommended by a friend. We were very impressed with the decor , the artwork and the atmosphere. After looking at the appetizers, we decided to make a meal of them and ordered 4 . Sauerkraut soup, Beef Pierogie, Foie Gras, and Herring. Each one was not only authentic , fresh and contemporary but presented beautifully ! Oops ! We also decided to try the Funeral Potatoes - fantastic! We couldn't finish it all , but had to have a taste. Next visit we can't wait to try the main entrees . Our server Nathalie was delightful and we would request her again. Deividas the owner is young, friendly and in my opinion has made his mark in Scottsdale, in just under 2 month. Welcome to the Valley, you are a refreshing change to the restaurant scene. Reservations are recommended- it was full the night we were there. \nFor my husband ( Russian decent) and I ( Lithuanian decent)  this is comfort food , held to the highest standard. A great evening!","8842":"I took classes from Keli here at CCT . She did such wonders on me I moved to Chicago to continue my training and no I am huge here! Ok, only kidding. But if you want an amazing teacher who knows the best in the biz then take from Keli. She can break you out of your shell and keep your mind flowing. The theater is small but it is all she really needs for know. She is worth the price and I did it for 18 weeks and loved it. Thanks Keli.","2135":"Our go-to place in Calgary.  Have yet to find anything better on the otherwise seafood-questionable prairie.","3529":"The perfect lunch spot indeed! Friendly staff that seem genuinely happy to see me every time I visit. The menu consists of everything you could ask for in a lunch setting (hot and cold sandwiches, soup, dogs and seafood!).  \n\nIt's just a quick drive from my office, so I usually frequent a few times a  month.  I'm always able to grab a table even when the place seems packed!  \n\nAnd bonus points for the awesome pic they have hanging up of past NBA greats getting their grub on.  #whatdude?","1180":"Another review from a few years back, really sorry, but wanted to make note of the places I loved when we lived in Champaign.\n\nOK, I read a lot of reviews a few years back (when this review was current) and found that people considered a place called First Wok a hidden gem.  Well, I didn't want to drive to First Wok.  Then Number One Wok opened (yes, this review is from when this business opened).  I picked up their menu.  It was almost exactly the same as First Wok.  Were they related?  Sure looked like it.  Are they still?  No idea.  Anyway, I found the menu amusing.  A lot of Chinese food menus have bad descriptions of the food and typos but this menu had NO Descriptions.  It was like a shot in the dark to figure out what some of the things were going to be.  So I gave it a try.  \n\nAnd I really liked it.  No, I didn't order any of the standard things like sweet sour whatever or broccoli cow.  I randomly picked things based on the protein or noodle base or whatever caught my attention.  I did this four or five times before I got some favorites going.  By the time my favorite order was going in once a week I was very happy with my food.  My mother came to visit and even SHE thought it was pretty damn good.  FYI our background is Chinese born in Hawaii where things might not be exactly authentic but good tasting food is super important.   A caveat: Takeout food is in a different category than sit down restaurant.  I am not comparing this place to the Chinese banquet restaurants.  That just wouldn't be fair.","1765":"The sushi at Harumi is fantastic! Fresh and delicious. The restaurant is small, chaotic, and usually kind of warm inside, but the service is fast and the sushi is the best. Harumi doesn't try to be fancy. They deliver a good quality product at a reasonable price.","5012":"WOW!  Amazing service!  Blaine was extremely helpful and really seemed to care about our satisfaction. He was prompt, efficient and best of all just solved our problem without any sales pitches! I highly recommend this location!","6803":"The owner (Simon, not Shlomo or Solomon or whatever he decides to call himself) is very arrogant. Our jaws dropped to the floor when we heard the slew of atrocious verbiage come out of his mouth in Hebrew. You'd be better served spending the extra money and going elsewhere. We came in from Orange County based on a recommendation and we wish we never wold've taken it. Everything is the cases is cheap, and inflated by 100s if not in some cases 1000s times more then the actual worth. Being in the jewelry business myself for over 20 plus years, it is a shame to see someone ruin it for everyone. After our first visit, we were convinced to go back and give Simon and the store another try. Maybe you caught him on a bad day, he's under a lot of pressure we were pitched. He tried convincing us that a, $3,000 at best, necklace that he also claimed he personally designed and crafted, was worth the $40,000 asking price. Great place to have your battery watch changed, but even then the service was subpar at best.","8209":"We love cloud 9 Pet sitting service. Our dogs used to be in a kennel, and when we noticed how stressed and tired they were when they came home, we decided to search for the right pet sitter. Angela and her staff are awesome with the dogs. The dogs really were relaxed, less stressed, and rested when we came back from our trip. This will be the only service we now use when it comes to our three dogs being watched. We also liked the fact that having the service (cloud 9) they get to check in on the house and make sure everything is OK while out of town. Highly recommended, and very professional.","4726":"Excellent airport. Although busy, it is very organized. The people there are very helpful. The airports and terminals are very clean. I fly out of Sky Harbor once a month. It's easily one of my favorite airports. The TSA are friendly. There's people wearing purple who are designated assistants, and are there when you need help navigating or to ask questions you may have. The selection is restaurants  in Terminal 4 keep getting better! They have a lounge you pay 40 dollars to access, I feel it is a fair deal. The money gets used back to advance the airport. The Sky Train is very fun to ride and is clean. This airport is undergoing major upgrades and this airport will be even better!","8152":"Really good! Quality pizza and super creative.  I usually don't write reviews but this place definitely deserves it (: \nCome back here if you want a quick delicious bite!","6852":"We had our order to go, and thoroughly enjoyed our entrees in the privacy of our own home.  We had plenty of leftovers, as the portion sizes were very generous.  The chicken was flavorful, and the steak was very tender.  We will be back!","8442":"When I enjoy the appetizers more than my entree, and have to wait a substantial amount of time between appetizers to my entree I think there is a problem.\nI usually don't like to rate bad, but personally I didn't enjoy my dinner.\nIt seems like a great place to nibble and drink mostly.","7408":"I have had a really tough time finding good Chinese food in Phoenix.  In the ten years I have lived here, nothing compared to the stuff I used to get at home.  I think this is common for a lot of people.  \n\nMy first impression walking into Golden Phoenix, is that the place is beautiful.  Sometimes Chinese restaurants look like they came from the 80's and refuse to leave.  I know that the decor doesn't make the food taste better, but this place is stunning!\n\nSpeaking of the food, I found it to be very tasty.  My dining companion ordered the hot and sour soup.  I generally  think that hot and sour soup tastes like a cigarette butt, but my companion enjoyed his.  I even tried a sip, and it was nice.\n\nWe also ordered kung pao chicken, and stir fried rice.  I was told that the fried rice was similar to what is common on the east coast.\n\nThe service was pleasant and there was some very cool live music.\n\nOverall I was pleased, and may have found my go-to Chinese restaurant.  And it only took 11 years.","701":"Locked myself out of my home late on a Sunday night. The locksmith arrived around 20 minutes after calling and I was in my house in no time. The locksmith was courteous and the interaction with the person at the office was great as well, they made sure to call me and ask if everything was going ok. If I need a locksmith again I would not hesitate on calling them.","6819":"Cora's is a cozy store. It definitely caught my senses- it's bright orange sign and smells of delicious freshly baked carbs! I've only tried their vegan love loaf and loved it! My sister had their chocolate walnut cookie and pizza and it did not disappoint.","4898":"Tried this place a few weeks ago, very cool and fun to hang out and play miniature golf with friends. We were in a group of 4 and we had a great time. Will definitely be coming back.","5781":"My husband and I went to top shot together. He has a lot of experience with firearms and mine is limited but we both had a fabulous time! If you've never shot before, this is a great way to get introduced. If you are an experienced shooter, you're going to love the experience this gives you. I feel more confident in my ability to defend myself after visiting here. This is a must do!","5580":"Got freshly hydroed tanks in for air refills, staff told me air refills with visual inspection is $30, I thought it was kinda expensive, but went through anyways. Went home and looked at their website, it clearly states visual inspection(includes new tank o-ring and air refill) for $19.95. Came back to shop to pick up my tanks and ask them about the price difference, staff said they have to charge more because the tank was freshly hydroed and their responsible for whatever happens to the tank. Paid and picked up my tanks, don't wanna argue for such a small stuff.\n\nMoral: what is the difference in responsibility between servicing a newly hydroed tank and one that is currently hydroed? Whatever happens to either tank they are still responsible. They didnt even change the o-rings (014). I will never do business with them again and so are my friends. A single costumer matters in the long run. Ex IDC staff.","2591":"All in all great bar - great beer selection, cozy seating areas, overall cool vibe. But it was the service I was super impressed with. I left my card here at the end of the night like a drunk idiot. Being an out of towner, I thought I had zero chance of ever seeing it again. But I talked to the manager and he mailed it to me the next day. Awesome.","6542":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Bar bites are the way to go though so you get a little taste of everything! Only $5 per plate and they have live music on the weekends. Great service too--all the bartenders always remember us and give us a warm greeting!","5372":"Creamy gelato with hefty servings of each scoop. Atmosphere was kind of like an old ice cream shop. Nice view of the main road of Scottsdale.","6912":"This place has been around as long as I can remember, and is as good as I remember.  I've dined in, I've done take-out.  I was worried that they might not survive with the big chain competitor opening in The Waterfront.  Now it seems that the competitor is simply overpriced.  I'm glad to see that Me Lyng seems to have made it through and will continue to do well.  The prices and the food are definitely worth it.","2949":"Literally the best optometrist I've ever been to. The entire staff was friendly. Dr. Manos was down to earth and engaged. The assistants never rushed us and gave honest opinions on the frames we were choosing. I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were! I highly recommend this place.","5792":"Ate here while staying at a local hotel. Was pleasantly surprised at the scrumptious fare offered here. While always busy, it didn't take long to get seated. The staff stays very busy turning empty tables; even that busy, servers pay close attention to your needs. Huge servings, great variety, and interesting specials. Had the fried sole with broccoli the first night. Fish was nicely done, lightly crisp, cooked perfectly.  One down side:  broccoli was stone cold. Took cheesecake back to my room for later. It was delicious -- light, creamy, and crumbly just like I like it. Not overly sweet. \nReturned for breakfast next day in a snowstorm. Not as busy yet. Tried the Hallah bread French toast with strawberries, bananas, pecans, and honey. Only had one piece, as the full order is two. It was enormous!!  But so delicious, I ate the entire thing!!  I will make this a regular stop when staying in the Pittsburgh area.","2448":"Great experience. .  Quick and convenient..  no overselling.   DR Peterson was thorough knowledgeable and professional.  No appointment needed..  I like that!  My schedule to busy to have to make appointments if I don't have to..","6973":"I've been to this place a couple times and enjoy it.  The food is always fresh and well prepared when I'm there and the prices are reasonable for what you're getting! \n\nI was so shocked to read the reviews below, maybe you went on a bad night when they were just opening? So bizarre as my food is always great. I LOVE THE BACON AND PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH.  ALSO awesome awesome desserts\n\nI also enjoy the environment and the service is usually good.","4662":"The setting is that of an old diner, which isn't that bad. The place seemed to cater to older folks and given the location, that is to be expected. \n\nThe prices are decent and the portions are huge. I had the Gorgonzola spinich dish and it left a little to be desired. My wife had the chicken Parmesan and she enjoyed that. The meal comes with garlice bread, which is excellent, a salad and the beverage. A good place if on a budget. Our waiter was terrible. I repeat terrible! At one point he brought the food to the people next to us and simply dropped out tea pitcher at our table. This stayed there for the deration of our meal. When he brought desert he did not bring a spoon. So rather than go to the station to get a spoon the kid took a spoon off of someone else's table as that person was eating and gave it to us. He did this right in front of us!\n\nWe got our bill and I tipped him just shy of 10%, which is fair considering the circumstances. Upon leaving the restaurant my wife had to use the restroom. This waiter took it upon himself to wait outside the restroom and confront my pregnant wife about our tip. He said to her sarcastically, I'm sorry if my service wasn't good enough. and walked away. Up until now I was willing to give this place a second chance, but not anymore. I would stay away from this place in favor of a more reasonable establishment.","259":"Our server was very friendly and helpful with giving us details on menu items. The service was quick and the food was delicious!! The atmosphere isn't anything extraordinary but for the quality of food at this price who cares .. The lazeez salad was super yummy and all of our chicken dishes (gyro, chili chicken and tiki chicken masala) were great too.","3785":"My husband got me a gift card to Buff n Nail, which I used yesterday and had some leftover because they were having an awesome 30% off deal their first month open! This place was so clean and the decor was so adorable! The staff were so nice, the receptionist came and sat with me while getting my pedicure just to talk. The two owners checked in on me multiple times to see if I was comfortable, needed more water, and if I was happy. I will definitely be going back and telling people to visit them when they need great service!","5864":"Best asian food ive had in Las Vegas thus far, everything we tried was amazing tiger salad, tom ka soup, pad see ooo, fried ice cream! The salad is still something i crave and its been like a week! Staff was extremely friendly and made the experience that much better!","5039":"Definitely a great experience for meeting quality people. Might be a bit pricey for some, but you get what you pay for. You have to take a risk to seek & find the person that's a right fit for you. Will recommend IJL to my family and friends.","8239":"Just moved in a few weeks ago.  Staff is very friendly, especially Jane.   We grill and go to the pool almost everyday.  We have a perfect view of the mountains from our balcony.  We had a couple of things in the apartment that needed maintenance and Ryan did a great job on fixing them.   He was very polite and respectful. So far so good!","286":"Awesome service! Super friendly! I checked in online the night before. They called me before they opened to check if I needed emergency help! Went in, signed in, vitals checked, Dr. PARKER was awesome! Highly recommend! I had a severe skin infection and hopefully the medication prescribed takes care of it. Thanks CareNow (on Cactus)!","2445":"Excellent tacos & Unbelievable salsa.  Chips were marginal and she apologized and agreed.   Atmosphere is quaint, art is fabulous.  Outstanding combination of flavors that will keep me coming back.","4217":"We have a unique 18 year-old Ralph Lauren leather chair and ottoman. It has beautiful stitching and looks custom. Unfortunately, years and the sun had taken a toll on our poor chair ensemble.\n\nWe called Chris, and he did a great job of repairing 4 major rips for us. He also is chasing down a leather cleaner\/conditioner- he says is the best he has tried- to help maintain our old, and our newer, leather pieces.\n\nFinally, he referred us to a leather specialist who will be able to remake the seat cushion for our chair.\n\nGreat stuff- thanks!","4861":"The chicken souvlaki is tender, generous, piping hot, grilled and flavorful. The salads are fresh and crisp with romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, red peppers, feta, etc. The pita is always fresh. The service is fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I love this place. The name is being changed to Gyros King.","5338":"One of the best philly cheese steaks I've had.  Have not really had anything else from them, but when I order this is pretty much what I get.  They deliver and that is awesome!  Really great if you are looking for a philly cheesesteak.  They chop the meat up very small and diced though.","6764":"I've been getting my hair cut from Lucy for years, before Fernando took over this spot - I'm so glad she stayed on.  Lucy has a great no-nonsense approach and gets you in and out fast, not to mention the price is great considering the location.  The physical improvements to the space since it came under new ownership have been appreciated.","4998":"After several months, I thought I'd give Joey's another try just to be fair. What a mistake.  Food is limp and tasteless.  Place was empty, but service was still slow and poor.  Oh, and the price has gone up.  As a matter of fact, I visit this center a few times a week, and Joey's is ALWAYS empty.  No mystery why.","6210":"Dr. Whetten has treated my whole family we have loved the treatment we have received He is the  best!! And very affordable!! Love the staff very friendly  You can tell they all love working with each other a fun family friendly office!!! I highly recommend this office for orthodontic treatment!!!!","5744":"Excellent spot!\nAfter living in the area for almost two years, this is the best spot -in my humble opinion, to get a chirashi!\n\nCame on a Saturday noon and the place wasn't packed, so service and food was definitely 5\/5 stars!","855":"We love great wolf lodge vacations, but the end of our visit this time was more than disappointing. We asked for a late check out and while we were out of the room for lunch, someone came in and started cleaning our room, realized we had a late check out and left. However, they left our room unlocked and all of our valuables were in the room. They didn't seem to care and even said it never would have been left open. They left the room with no sheets and pillows all over the floor, so there was nowhere to rest, they threw my pillowcase from home in the laundry and threw out the entire bag of candy my son won in the arcade (which was devastating for him as he has some processing issues). When I brought it to their attention, they did nothing, and I wasn't even reimbursed the late check out fee. We were so disappointed...","3763":"I only ever bring my car here for tire\/wheel work and always have a great experience. Appointments are quick and easy over the phone; the call is always answered promptly and courteously, I'm always booked at the most convenient time for me, and even so I've NEVER had to wait more than an hour for work to get done. Even if there's people in line ahead of you, the employees acknowledge you when you come in the door: Hello, we'll be right with you.\n\nWhat really impressed me on my last appointment was the honesty of the guys behind the desk. It was a long time since I bought a tire (or had a rotation), so I went in telling the employees Whatever you say the car needs. They measured the tread on the tires, showed me on a chart how the tread compared and what sort of shape it is it, and gave me a free rotation. They could have sold me new tires I didn't need and I would never have known the difference. And THAT'S why I keep going to this Discount Tire.","6920":"I'll keep it simple.. If you are in Vegas, you are better off drinking in your room than coming to CWC. \n\n+ margaritas are pretty good\n+ chips were stale and salsa was not that tasty\n+ service SUCKS - slow and rude.\n\nWe came to Cabo Wabo Cantina because we had a 2 for 1 margarita coupon. Thank goodness, we didn't eat there because the food did not look very good and would probably not settle well in our stomachs. And to top it off, the service was HORRIBLE! Our waiter was rude and seemed pissed off that we were there. He did not even bother to ask us what type of margarita we wanted. Instead, he just got us the flavor that was most convenient for him. \n\nI'm happy I now know not to ever come back here again!","845":"This place is definitely mediocre and I agree with all the reviews  that deem this little hole in the wall 'overpriced,' because it really is. I ventured over to this spot last night for a quick bite to eat--I was craving spicy salmon rolls like you wouldn't even believe--and I left feeling unsatisfied. Firstly, $6.75 for a spicy salmon roll (with 5 dinky pieces) is really unacceptable. I mean I don't even think it was made fresh and it was not (I repeat, not) spicy in the least bit. Although I must admit the Chicken teriyaki was good--fresh vegetables, delicious sauce--I feel that you could get the same thing at a food court in a mall somewhere. Hell, even 'Teriyaki experience' at Centre Eaton serves up a good teriyaki stir-fry.\n\nThe service was bizarre. The waitress did not speak a word to me--from the moment I  walked in (she motioned me to an open table) to the time I left, it was mostly grunts and head nodding. I usually go out of my way to say 'oh, thanks' or 'how are you,' but it would have been like talking to a brick wall with this one. She was a piece of work. \n\nThe decore is very mundane. Its basically like title flooring with a splash of this nasty blue paint on the walls. The tables are wobbly and the chairs are IKEA. Nothing wrong with IKEA but for $25 for one roll and a teriyaki I expect at least a little effort on presentation. I should've known--if there are only two other diners in the joint at 6 pm its probably not where you want to spend your precious sushi dollars. \n\nEven Sushi Crescent--an AYCE place--was infinitely better in taste, price, and quantity. Go figure!","6829":"Really expensive but high quality sushi. Appetizer Tako Wasabi is very fresh and delicious. Comfortable atmosphere. Looks like it used to be a diner of some sort but they did a good job with decor. Love coming here with my husband to spend some quality time. Friendly staff.","6954":"I love that they explain things.  They give me the price before they start repairs so there are no surprises.very reasonable. I've taken my cars in for years.","4626":"On the spur of the moment we called at 7:15 pm on a Saturday night and asked for a reservation for 7:35 as we were 20 minutes away. With a genuine German sense of order we were told we could only have a reservation for 7:45 which we gladly took. Arriving at 7:35 our table was waiting for us. \n\nThe schnitzels and sausages and cherry strudel our group of four ordered was excellent. So was the Wahrsteiner draft dark beer. Our group of four split two entrees and the wait staff was very gracious about and there was no split plate fee, although we were served with four plates.  \n\nExcellent food and gracious service. Yes, we will be back.","7607":"Wee Blessings is hands down the best preschool in Chandler. The teachers are amazing.  The facility is beautiful and CLEAN! And the owners, Phil and Debi Chavez make everyone feel safe, warm and welcome. I would absolutely recommend Wee Blessings to anyone wanting the best head start for their child.","6501":"I have been trying to give this place a chance ( because it's so close to my house) even after one of the stylists there did such a HORRIBLE job when dying my hair. Well I Came home to realize my hair look like a cheetah in the back . Went back 3 times to try and get them to fix it... Recently took my son to get his hair cut and I believe it was the owner that was cutting his hair. I specifically told her NOT to cut the top, well guess what that's the first thing she did. I showed her a pic of what I wanted and of course not even close. The back was horribly slanted. Came home to have husband fix it. So, Just because you own a hair salon DOES NOT MEAN YOU KNOW HOW TO CUT HAIR! WORSE place EVER. Btw, there are 2 locations I visit the one on Sahara. But the girls I do believe switch up salon from time to time...","2062":"Great vodka cocktails with a unique middle eastern twists; and the food is pretty great too!","2401":"My sister and I had lunch at this place yesterday.  So disappointing.  Not much variety.  The sushi was OK.  Most of the other food was cold!  The hot and sour soup had a smoky taste, yuk!  The dumplings in the wonton soup were very hard.  The only good thing on the dessert table was the tiramisu and fresh fruit.  Would not recommend this establishment to anyone and certainly would not return!  I had the runs this morning!","5404":"Swans at a hotel?! What?!! I love that there are swans and fish right in the lobby at the hotel. I find that really cool. The rooms are pretty nice and the breakfast is good too. If you need a hotel in Vegas, you should definitely consider this place to stay at.","6533":"This place is outstanding!  Not expensive and not fancy, nut the food is truly incredible.  If you like mediterranean flavors, this is a must try!","3568":"The southwest burger is awesome with its jalape\u00f1o bacon, wow!!! My gf ordered the chicken bltg.  The chicken breast was huge, juicy, and flavorful, just how I like'em. We also shared a side if onion rings.  They were crispy and not dripping oil. And they were very generous with their bacon servings","3932":"The fish and chips are great!  The fish is always cooked perfect and the fries are never too greasy or too crispy.  The prices are reasonable and the employees are friendly.","8702":"Fresh delicious donuts!! Ability to customize any way you like or you can pick from some suggested flavors\/toppings. Either way, you'll love whatever you get!! Some personal favorites were cinnamon sugar w vanilla frosting or the peanut butter & chocolate drizzle!","6682":"Burgers were pretty good. I had the Nad-alie and my husband had the Tallulah Hula. We shared the Cajun fries which were just okay. I had the Peach is in Fashion Manhattan which was okay as well. Our server was very attentive and nice. Sitting outside (upstairs) was really nice!","3839":"Love the food! And the location! Easy to grab a healthy dinner here before a movie. Highly recommend trying Me Va Me out!","1463":"We have been to Mon Ami Gabe ' 5 times now.That should say something. The food is above good and the service is always great. See you next year.","8809":"Robuchon's tasting menu was excellent  We took up the waiter's offer for him to pick wine pairings for us, and instead of a specific flight, with one per course (which would have killed me) he did a half a glass with every other course.  The half glasses were very generous, and I was rather tipsy on excellent wine, along with a great meal.  We were actually also given matching desert wines on the house.  That being said, it still almost came out to $500 with a generous tip, but it was well worth it.","6309":"Just what a neighborhood pizza place should be. Great food. Good prices.  Great staff.","5252":"Wonderful show.  Mac King is a wonderful comedian and an incredible magician.  I though I was following him and then he just kept making me not believe what he was doing.  Very awesome show.  Definitely recommended.","7424":"For being the fastest of fast food, tb is okay. Decent flavors and options, such as bowls and meatless options. I would rate them above los fav and filibertos taste and quality-wise BUT 9 times out of 10 orders are wrong, missing food or some such issue.\nI can't check to see if they got my order right in the car, unwrapping all items, so I usually find out after I get home. Obviously the employees know this and may not care.\nService varies greatly from lunch hour to late night. Employees seem to be friendlier and more engaging during the day. I suppose it is what it is.","6157":"New York City sports fans probably should stay away; this is seriously a Boston-themed sports bar.  Or maybe it is a pizzeria, or then again, maybe a diner.\n\nThe menu probably could use some editing; there is something for everyone here, but our fried ravioli appetizer suggested that maybe they should stick to what they do well.\n\nThat being said, the pizza that we had, Prosciutto's House, with, appropriately enough, prosciutto, mozzarella, and feta, was as good as pizza gets.\n\nWe were there on a weeknight, but the service was attentive.  There is a fairly good selection of beers and wines, both of which were served cold.  It is a friendly and comfortable place with great pizza.","6212":"Tried it for the first time this evening and it was very good.  Would have earned 5 stars, but the fries were warm, not hot.  The burgers were fantastic, service was quick and friendly, could not ask for more in those areas!  Will definitely be going back!","4292":"Not only was the good amazing but the service was impeccable! It was our first time dining at Raku and the staff was really good about making sure we knew how to eat everything, what everything was, their recommendations, etc. Very very impressed!","4077":"I love this place.  The menu rotates occasionally, and there is a specials board when you walk in (make sure to check the board or ask the server...sometimes the servers forget to tell you about the specials).  Food had always been stellar, from the basic burger to elegant salads, intriguing pizzas, and awesome pastas.  My fav is the gorgonzola gnocci, which is a rotating item.  Dessert is also good, maybe a bit pricey.  Creme brulee is always there and very good, gelato too.","5139":"This formerly great steak house has closed after 51 years.  It should be removed from the Yelp database.","5490":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The staff (every single one of them!) is friendly, welcoming, passionate, and knowledgeable. The food was adventurous and creative, and everything was delicious. Don't miss the tongue, and the syrah they have right now is to die for. Also, I know this seems odd, but it's true: best manhattan (and best cherries) I've ever had. Well worth the price.","4222":"I don't get here very often but I always love their carne asada. Flavorful, tender, and tasting of the flame. The outdoor patio round back is great with water fountains, trees, and that old world feel.  A great place to bring the wife or meet a client for lunch.","2259":"Whoever is reading this, I strongly advise you to never purchase anything from Sears. \n\nEspecially anything considered a large purchase. I spent over 6k on appliances for my new house. I bought a washer, dryer, refrigerator, oven, and over-the-range microwave here. This is the third biggest purchase of my life behind my house and car, and I deeply regret giving my money to sears. The washer and dryer came and were installed just fine but that is where my good experience ends. The microwave install was completely botched. My wife was the only person home, and the installer drilled a ~3'' diameter hole for the power cord to feed through my cabinet. Unfortunately, it was drilled in the wrong place so he had to re-drill, so I now have a gaping hole in my cabinet. He did not fasten it down, so the microwave rocks back and forth when I open the door. He also stripped the screws on the install, and deformed the microwave trying to get it to fit. He also put very large holes in my wall, because he did not install the microwave mounting hardware correctly, and had to also redo that a second time. Completely shoddy work, and I would be ashamed to associate myself with a contractor like that if I were sears. My wife is not handy so she did not know to check for these things and keep the installer there, but at the same time she should not have to considering we paid an extra $120.00 for the install on a $400.00 microwave. At that price it should have been done professionally.\n\nThe salesman talked me into a refrigerator that was not on the floor, an LG model, and then somehow a Kenmore showed up at my house. I called the store to fix these 2 issues and was told a manager would call me back. No call back. Called the next day and was assured a manager would call me immediately. No call back. I finally had to drive 25 minutes to the store and then waited around for 30 minutes to see a manager. Their manager John was completely unprofessional and overall gave off a vibe that he did not care. He seemed more interested getting away from the situation rather than fix it. I got the refrigerator that I wanted finally but overall it was a hassle because I had to be home for a second day for the second delivery\/install.\n\nThe microwave re-install was for some reason pushed out 2 more weeks. The day before the install, I received a call and found out they had my address wrong. Funny enough, I had them correct my address in the two previous trips to sears, so I don't know how it ended up still being wrong. Then, the person on the phone told me that since they had to change my address they would have to push the delivery date back yet again. By the way, all of sears customer service phone calls are routed to India. I am not racist, but there is very obviously a language barrier and I definitely felt like the person on the phone did not empathize with my situation, most likely because they were reading a script. The worst part of all this was they told me it was my responsibility to call them in 48 hours to get my new delivery date. When I protested to try and tell them that was unacceptable, the representative just kept repeating You will have to call back in 24-48 hours.\n\nAt the end, I am returning everything. I've never experienced anything quite this bad in my entire life. I consider myself a reasonable person, and I try to give the benefit of the doubt when dealing with situations like this so I am just in utter disbelief that this many things could go wrong with no help to fix it on Sear's end.\n\nIt is no wonder to me that Sears is losing business. If you read this far, I hope my experience inspires you to never purchase anything at Sears. The level of frustration of spending this much money and having this many problems is unparalleled to anything I have ever dealt with. Please avoid at all costs!","8551":"Nothing crazy here. The Fiji-Oahu on brown rice is what I always get. High quality food with no frills. Wouldn't die if I couldn't ever eat it again but I would be sad  that I would need to find another easy and inexpensive yet reliable meal.","7363":"I had very long hair so came in to cut about 8 inches off. My hair is very thick yet easy to manage because it's straight. I came in at 3 and left at 6pm I have my color done elsewhere and it doesn't take that long! Daniel my hair dresser simply put had no idea what he was doing. It was painful he pulled so hard, the shampoo was horrible and didn't even feel good at all! (that's my favorite part) he used a comb to brush through my hair and it was already DRY by the time he was half way done! Ladies and gentlemen, if you want someone who knows how to cut hair and cut it well, he would not be a good choice. Luckily, the manager was nice about it and felt badly for me. I hope they provide him more training before putting him on the floor when he doesn't know a thing about doing a straight forward cut. The entire experience was awful. I'm not sure why Toni and Guy has gone downhill as much as it has. Disappointing.","8262":"The owner of the business has contacted me since my first review.  He was very apologetic about the delays and inconvenience it has caused me and my family.  He offered to rectify the situation by switching out the futon but unfortunately the original fabric we selected was no longer in production.   As a substitute he gave us a slip cover in a different fabric.  I appreciate him addressing the situation and resolving our dissatisfaction.","4152":"I'm embarrassed to say that my first time at Pho Tien Thanh was only 6 short months ago. I guess I've never really had a craving for this Vietnamese staple, and it's probably the result of a string of mediocre experiences. But, now that I've been to Pho Tien Thanh, I can't stop myself from wanting (and dreaming about) that delicious first sip of broth. It's probably the most comforting thing I have ever tasted in my life!\n\nThe different combinations of noodle soups seem endless after glancing through their menu, but I'd recommend you go with the rare beef noodle soup (#23 ), and make sure you get the large.\n\nAnd if you're feeling under the weather, this is the perfect dish to get some life back into you.","3046":"It's so nice to come to a hotel in Vegas that is clean, quiet and restful. Not the usual Vegas bling and noise.","7073":"I came across this gym when I bought a groupon that included boot camp classes from this gym.  At first when you walk in, you do notice the equipment is outdated.  But the main trainer is one of the best I've experienced.  I felt it was ideal for beginners and those who have experience training.  \n\nEvery boot camp class was different and I attended 3 a week. Different music was played each class, so it was never the same.  Each boot camp class had different exercises so I was never bored.  We worked on every aspect of exercise, core, cardio, weight training, stretching, etc.  The teacher did go back and forth from English and Spanish which I thought was considerate since both Spanish and English speaking people were attending the class.  \n\nOne of the things I noticed was since I had bought a groupon, the trainers at the gyms I attended are notified you're a groupon buyer, almost like a label, and didn't show as much attention to me as they did to others.  As a groupon buyer you're not paying full price so it can show from the place you're at they won't give you full service.  At this gym this wasn't the case.  On two different occasions I was the only one who showed up for the boot camp class and instead of him cancelling he provided 1 on 1 personal training.  He was basically working for free but trained me like a full paying customer.  \n\nBottom line he's an excellent trainer who knows his stuff and cares about everyone that walks in the door.  The gym may not be the biggest or the newest but that's nothing in comparison to receiving quality training.  And that's what you'll get at GAP fitness.","5231":"Was served a bread basket with refrigerated bread.  Had to ask the waiter for bread that was room temperature.  Ordered the lobster bisque, worst lobster bisque ever.  Tasted as I imagine dirty dish water with fish heads would taste.  Management took the cost of the bisque off the ticket.  I had the lamb and it was bland and severely over salted.  The cauliflower was charred beyond recognition.  We decided to cut our losses and did not order dessert.  Wait staff was not attentive.  Be wise and spend your money elsewhere!","5034":"Just realized that as of today I have been going to this nail salon for a whole year already! I have no complaints. I've gotten my nails and toes done by almost every single tech. They're all great.","7735":"Always get my order done quick. I love\nthe iced green tea and the caramel frap, my son loves the birthday cake pop. The staff is so nice too.","5791":"I have to say everyone I dealt with at Berge VW was wonderful.  Russ, Danny & Robert in sales couldn't have been nicer.   Marc in finance was very pleasant to deal with and funny too.  I would definitely recommend this dealership & plan to go back again whenever I get my next car.","6885":"WOW!!! This show was amazing!! We had seats on the very back row and still loved it, truly and edge of your seat show. I had the privilege of seeing MJ in person in 1988 and I really believe he would be proud of how this show represents his music and legacy. I will definitely go back and see it again.","7511":"Second large group experience here.\n\nOut with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)\n\nThe wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.  \n\nI was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.\n\n\nEDIT: \nIf you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.\n\nIf you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you.","7171":"Spokehaus is the first spin studio I have tried so I can't really compare it to anything else. Based on what I have heard from other friends who spin though, it seems to be more focused on the upper body than lower body. The classes are really fun. All of the instructors are friendly, motivating and have a great attitude. The music is always great and it is really fun to do the choreography (they offer special classes like raggaeton, hip hop, kanye, eminem). The Hot Box class is killer. A few notes: the classes are a bit on the expensive side and the front desk staff aren't always the friendliest. I also wish that they offered more classes on the weekend. Other than that, definitely worth checking it out.","3951":"This place is amazing! The kothu roti is made fresh to order - it's delicious, the portions are generous and reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It has become my go-to place for a quick meal in Queen west.","4587":"The cherro is frozen & there is paper in the ice cream this place is not good and to priceless  good luck next time maybe","563":"I live in Liberty Village and had passed by Liberty Noodle many times, but it was never open when we wanted to go.  I should note that my husband is noodle-obsessed...finally decided to try it on a Friday evening.  \nWhen we arrived, there was no hostess at the greeting desk...we waiting about 5 minutes before a girl showed up and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  It was evident that she was playing hostess, server, and busser for the whole restaurant.  The restaurant was very modern looking, with high ceilings and long benches.  We ordered a beer and the Ginger Lime Crush, which ended up being half a cup of pure ginger juice with some club soda and sugar thrown in.  It was undrinkable.  Oh, and the server played bartender as well.  My husband ordered a Sapporo...they were out of it.  He ordered a Kirin...also out.  Asahi...out.  So he settled on Heineken (it was that or a Corona).\nWe (2 of us) ordered the chicken wings, black bean chicken, and Japanese beef curry.  Wings were panko-crusted, crispy, and good...five wings on the plate, with bottled sweet and sour dipping sauce.\nBeef curry was also surprisingly good, but seriously lacking in quantity!  3\/4 of the plate was plain steamed rice, with maybe a half-cup of the curry on the side.  It was tasty enough that I wished there was more.\nThe black bean chicken was tasteless, and no evidence of black bean on the plate.  Again, a TINY portion.\nOverall, poor value for quantity, sorely lacking service (though I can't blame the server for being overworked), and so-so food.  We both decided we wouldn't be returning, and stopped by Hero burger on the way home :)","7446":"We tried this place twice and hated it! The prices are ridiculous and there was no meat in the sandwich. I hated the cheese and the meat was fatty. I have been to Philly  and an original cheesesteak and this is not even close. I thought Capriottis was great compared to this place but it went a little down hill they use less meat and it's dry. If you want a great Philly go to Mikes burgers and cheesesteaks","7011":"I love VOLCANO GRILLE so much. Very friendly staff been seeing them since they were at the warmsprings location. I always order the Bento Box, all steak; all rice. Super duper delicious, steak is so juicy and tender and omg the BOMB! I also love their new location, much more closer to me haha, i come almost 3 times a week! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS place! Thank you Volcano Grille for always satisfying my rice and steak cravings! Onelove and see you guys soon!","6307":"SMASH BURGER is a great place for lunch.\nNick is very hospitable and made lunch perfect !!!\n\nDouble Malt Salted-Caramel Malt !!!\nMmmmmmmmmmm","4264":"Every bite was absolutely delicious!\n\nThe interior is gorgeous! At first when my husband and I walked in with our two young children we almost left because it looks so nice inside and we thought maybe it wasn't appropriate for our kiddos. However the entire staff was gracious to our whole family from the very start and made us feel very welcome.\n\nMy husband, who is Mexican, and grew up in New Mexico is a hard judge for Mexican food-- loved everything. Especially the queso  fundido  (hope I am spelling that right). He said, tastes just like it does back home. A huge compliment! We both had a three taco platter and the tacos were so expertly crafted, they take you to a different place. The fish taco transported me back to my childhood in San Diego and had a very Baja feel. Then there were several marinated tacos that were so reminiscent of our time spent in the Yucatan peninsula, which is a whole different style of Mexican food that most people have never had.\n\nThen the tequila selection! We are always so disappointed by other restaurant's selections because there are so many really good tequilas out there. We will definately be back sometime soon without the kiddos enjoy  a couple of tequila flights with some more excellent tacos!","2790":"We have been going to Tyler Hamelwright for two years and found him to be helpful, professional and personable. We highly recommend him!","335":"My Grandson attends Journey Education, we love the school. The best part about Journey is that they care for each and every child. The classes are small and the teachers are wonderful. The tuition cost is lower then most private schools in Las Vegas.","6586":"I was very disappointed.  My wife I tried Fuzzy's based on the reviews and both of us found this pizza to be below par.  Nothing like good Chicago pizza.  We ordered a sausage and mushroom 16 and I think we got 12 mushrooms and 8 pieces of sausage.  The pizza had lots of cheese but very little flavor.  We won't be back.","8428":"Yum! Went here today and it was great. Had monte cristo. Very clean, service is great, food came quick. They have food for everyone the menus is big. Only con is it may be a little pricey but worth it,","4952":"This place is remarkably awesome!  Went in with a half stolen bike a couple weeks back and Adam hooked me up with a better set up on a new bike. \n\nEven though bikes seem rather simple (get on bike and pedal), Adam helped me find the BEST bike for my situation. For that, I am forever grateful. \n\nAlso, the 5-day tuneup included with the purchase of a new bike there was great. There was a small creak in the hub (which apparently was common in the latest run of specialized bikes to come from the factory), and Adam told the mechanics to change it out without charging me. So I ended up buying more stuff to add to my bike.   Win win!! \n\nSuper easy experience and that is worth a ton for a biker noob like me.","5888":"This is one seriously professional operation. It is top cabin and Sue O'Conner can figure out the best golf equipment to enhance your golf experience on any course, male or female. You will pay a premium  price but it is with a premium product you will not get from the regular sales operations. I have purchased 3 sets of clubs over 10 years and I have yet to be disappointed. If you decide to receive their golf experience, give Sue a hug for me. She and they are the real deal","8144":"This is the first time I've been to a Laredo's in quite some time and my first visit to this Laredo's location. Unfortunately, it confirmed my general feeling that the quality of the food at these restaurants has declined in recent years. \n\nThe first impression arrived in the form of brown, overcooked tortilla chips. I ate two. Next, I was in the mood for a lighter lunch, so I ordered the tortilla soup. The dish arrived topped with oily tortilla strips and big, dense chunks of cheese that reminded me of paneer and really did nothing to enhance the dish. After a cursory taste, I removed the toppings. The broth was okay but not great, and the vegetables were overcooked. My dining partners were similarly unimpressed.\n\nThis is sad, because Laredo's was my favorite Mexican place when I first moved to Madison. The last several visits have netted sub-par food. Not to mention that I live in DeFo now, and Aranda's is just around the corner. (If you want really good Mexican food at a friendly, family-owned place, I'd suggest going there.)","2334":"Belgian waffles done right. This cafe offers waffles, sandwiches and salads with some European flare. Try the smoked salmon waffle Benedict. It comes with a pickle and apple slaw that is the perfect mix of sweet and savory. Quintessential Toronto brunch.","4640":"It sounded good when I was quoted 45 dollars but not so great when they charged me 60 after giving my pup the worst groom of his life. The groomer seemed rushed when I dropped him off and that made me quite nervous given that he is epileptic and I showed up 10 minutes early to have this conversation with her. My pup has never had a seizure after a groom but he did this time. It must have been a terrible experience for him! Never again.","4294":"April 13, 2014 - Came in for simple brake job ($90-$130), received lies and enough shadiness to cover Vegas in Summer ($380-$420). Don't talk to Schaeffer or the fat New Yorker guy that backed Schaeffer's lie.\n-::FULL STORY::- \nSo I came in with an $89 coupon to get my rear brakes done with intention of paying the extra $30 for ceramic. The rear brakes have not even started to squeal, so my rotors should be fine. Schaeffer comes back and tells me that composite rotors cannot be cut and that I need new rotors. Right now I know this is a little shady but I still deal because maybe the place doesn't have the correct tools to cut the rotors (Later I found that my OEM rotors are not only NOT composite, but that IT IS POSSIBLE TO CUT COMPOSITE ROTORS and only bad\/fresh mechanics still face fear on composite rotors - so at the very least, if not complete liars, they're amateurs and charge a lot). Next, Schaeffer tells me that it's my front brakes that need to be replaced!! It's cleary my rear breaks! There's so much meat on my front brakes that I had to provide pictures for a comparison so any reader can partake in this total ridiculousness (granted it was probably the mechanic who told Schaeffer wrong or maybe there was a miscommunication, but one glance will tell you what's what. Amateurs.). Finally, they hit me with the price and that a slap job of putting brakes on is going to make the car shake-rattle-and maybe roll. Just check the picture to see how smooth my rotors really are. Shaking may have happened on a slap job, but it wouldn't be to the scale they were on about. In the end, I wound up shopping around to two other places. Came up on a deal for $125 with a $25 rebate. Maybe it was because the tax day hit was on everyone's mind, but I wouldn't trust this Big-O for the time of day.\n\nTo be fair, previously, in March or February, I went here to get an oil change. I forgot the coupon & the guy (about 5'5-5'7, short black hair, a little stocky, really friendly; not the previous two involved) cut me break on that. Also, they did not have the filter and I had to wait an additional 1.5 hours but he didnt charge me for it because of the wait. So I'd give an extra half star if I could, but this mess is so unforgiveable I cannot oblige giving them of one Whole extra star.\n\nUpdate: This new place that checked my brakes says I'm good for another 5-6 months. I thought I needed back brakes because of something Purrrfect Auto said about 7-9 months ago. With the wheels off you can see my back brakes have a lot more meat on them than I originally thought (the shadow from having the wheels on is a bit deceiving). If anyone's interested to where I went, check my reviews. I'd rather not let these jerks have the satisfaction of having an excuse to discredit this review. Can't believe I wasted a whole work day because of these ass clowns.","5015":"Almost a 40 minute wait for one pad Thai and nothing else. The staff didn't seem to care and just said we have new kitchen staff. Will not be back.","8831":"Very delicious!\n\nWife had apple and Brie burger, I had the big kahuna, both were fantastic!","8672":"Tomo sushi!!\nI've been to many many japanese restaurants which are all average, but Tomo is definitely above average. The place isn't too big, but its definitely really nicely renovated with decor and the atmosphere of the place makes it feel expensive.\nThe sushi is absolutely amazing!! Every roll is nicely rolled up so nothing falls apart. Everything is presented nicely. Sashimi is as fresh as it gets. Everything is amazing, except the price. Its a bit pricey for some of those specialty rolls if you compare it to other places, but Its definitely worth the price. \nService is pretty good, very attentive waiters\/waitresses. \nIf you love sushi, then definitely hit Tomo up!\n\nNote - miso soup is awesome!","7668":"Had steak with pepper corns. Excellent!  Friend had meat loaf which was also excellent.   Service was very good.  First time here will go back","4329":"Not sure if this place was having an off day today but I was very disappointed especially with the customer service which amounted to zero.  \n\nFirst of all, I phoned this business to ask about a particular herb plant and no one answered or returned my call.  I drove there from the South Hills nonetheless and took a chance.  When I arrived there were only 3-4 cars in the entire lot.  Is there a reason someone can't answer a phone?  They have a girl at the register doing nothing but she can't answer the phone?  I heard it go straight to voice mail while I was checking out. I was the ONLY person checking out.  That's the beginning of the poor customer service. \n\nThen, while I'm going through all the greenhouses not a single staff member asked if I needed help, was I looking for anything in particular etc?  Not one.  There are about 6-8 staff at 11a on a Thursday and an equal number of customers. You do the math ratio.  Additionally, the staff purposefully averted their eyes so they wouldn't have eye contact and then be more obligated to offer help!  Really rude inexcusable behavior.  \n\nI phoned Soergels in Wexford and asked for the herb I was searching for and they offered to put some aside for me until I can get there Saturday morning.  Now THAT'S customer service!","5089":"I really like this place, but I had to dock it one-star simply because the service and some of the menu items could be improved (very easily, I might add). I love the super nachos w\/carne asada and the chicken quesadillas (no veggies added) w\/sour cream on the side. So good!","3319":"What a great experience. I walked in, they were able to replace my window right away. They matched the Groupon coupon so I didn't have to go through the hassle of buying and redeeming. It was cheaper than my last glass at the dealership. FYI don't buy the Groupon just go in and ask for the In-house Groupon. \nThe office is clean and welcoming so waiting isn't a big deal. They had the NHL playoffs in the TV and those yummy old fashioned lollipops for free if u had low sugar\nI put off replacing my windshield because I didn't want the hassle and to wait in some nasty garage. Next time I'll just make an appointment. Great service!","105":"Kali Jones hooked up my hair. She is so great and didn't let me leave until the color was correct and she was happy with it. Great salon and great service. Excellent excellent excellent.","8013":"It is no exaggeration to say that this is the single worst restaurant in Kensington Market. It doesn't even deserve the name Kensington's.\n\nWe ordered two all-day breakfasts, and asked for no meat. They told us we'd get extra grilled veggies instead. The grilled veggies consisted of three one-millimeter-thick slices of soggy zucchini, and three rotten slices of what could technically be classified as eggplant. The potatoes tasted like cardboard, and the eggs had a nasty greasy brown film all over them. We were rudely refused refills on our tiny $2.25 coffees.\n\nI'm amazed that this place is still in business, especially since it occupies such a prime piece of real estate in the market. Kensington Market would be better off with a Tim Horton's on that corner. Or a McDonalds. Or even an abandoned storefront.","5318":"LOVE this place.  \n\nThe atmosphere and the decor  is classy and the vibe is decidedly sexy.  While on the smaller size in terms of space, it is far from cramped and uncomfortable.  I celebrated my birthday here with some girlfriends and we had a fantastic time.\n\nWhile I don't drink (not court or rehab mandated either) my friends raved about the Premarita Margarita, their signature drink made with Partida tequila and agave nectar.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the guacamole which is made tableside.  Since some of the ladies prefer their guac a bit spicier than the others, our server was happy to accomodate our requests.  I had the chicken tacos which were the perfect size for me.  I think that a man may look at the 3 small tacos on my plate and wonder what else was for dinner but for me it was perfect.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a delicious flavor that just spicy enough without searing my tastebuds off.  \n\nFor desert, my friend made me a home-made birthday cake that she brought in and for a small cake-cutting fee, was presented to me (with trick candles and sparklers no less!)  The service that we had was top notch.  Brian, the owner, made sure that we were taken care of and helped to make the evening special.  The bartender and server were both attentive, quick, and friendly.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful birthday dinner.  I have never had a bad experience at The Mission and can't wait to return.","6305":"I will come back when I have more gourmet doughnuts but these were really good. Had the salted caramel and it was this salty delicious treat. Also the pastor I think it is called (one with hazelnut on top) was not to sweet bit that Tims could never replicate.","3253":"Great burgers available all the time. Do not go if you are in a rush but definitely worth the wait. Highly recommended!","8773":"I am so glad I purchased a Living Social deal for Townsley Portraits after looking at a bunch of other offers. They were able to accommodate time and my requested beach location around a busy work schedule and being a single mom.\nStuart was so nice and could not have interacted better with my active 5 year old. \nHe quickly moved to multiple locations around the beach and didn't waste any time- all while making us laugh and having fun. \n\nI was also able to schedule my shoot review the next day.\n\nEveryone has been very professional and great to work with!

My hair and make-up lasted up the whole time. They were a perfect choice!","1033":"Had a few drinks at the bar and Chiara provided us with excellent service!! The cocktails were well made and the antipasto platter was a great snack. We will definitely be back!","758":"I can't understand what's the hype about this place.\n\nAfter reading many good reviews, decided to go there for breakfast. \n\nFirst of all, service was mediocre - had to wait about 15 minutes to order. Waited another good 20 minutes for our food, that wasn't all that great: hash brows were soggy (like they were dipped on water and then served), pancakes weren't cooked long enough (tasted like raw batter)  and Maple BLT sandwich was nothing special. \n\nSTAY AWAY.","3296":"This used to be a Golds Gym and it was awesome then!! Since its been change to a EOS Fitness it just seems to go downhill. The broke equipment seems to stay broke and the facility always seems dirty. The staff also isn't the friendliest. They don't clean out the pool very often so it feels like you have oil on your skin when you get out. The bathrooms usually have toilet paper all over the ground, which I don't understand why people do that that's a customer issue. They showers seem to be broken a lot so it's unpredictable if you'll be able to shower there after your workout. Wish this was still golds they seemed to care more about it then.","3447":"Tried this place out for the first time last week with high hopes as Mexican food is my absolute favorite cuisine! \n\nI walked in and was taken back by the lack of customer service that came from the staff. I ordered a taco salad and a hard shell taco on the side. The one plus is the food didn't take more than 15 mins to get to our table.\n\nOnce it arrived I looked at my taco salad and thought this isn't a taco salad, there was no hard shell, beans or nothing! It was a plate of shredded lettuce, ground beef, cheese and a small dollop of sour cream. I asked the young man who brought it if I could have ranch he said they didn't have it. I said ok can I have thousand island he says sorry we don't have any dressing. I'm thinking to myself how do you have salads on your menu with no dressing available?! \n\nMy taco looked appetizing until I realized it wasn't even hard shell but a flour tortilla that had been fried. I was hoping for a corn hard shell. Plus it was overt greasy and the salsa on it was terrible! \n\nI left unimpressed and felt it was way overpriced. I don't plan on going back, save your money and go to Las Fuentes or Rio Mirage.","3532":"This is my spot to get a hoagie Philly cheese steak btw. Nice, friendly people that work there. I always call ahead of time for my order so as soon as I pull up its ready. Good spot.","1362":"I would give Barberian's a 5 if it weren't for the fact that they are inconsistent!\n\nThere have been times where the steaks I've ordered were cooked to perfection, other times burnt and overcooked.  Suggestion, if you order medium rare tell them meidum rare and a little bit on the rare side.  I've pretty much tried every steak on their menu and their filet mignon is my favorite. The fact that 1 side is included makes the meal worth it in comparison to other steakhouses..ala  harbour sixty.\n\nThe decor is dark, kind of your stereotypical steak house and it is a more mature crowd.  If you want an above average steak this is the place to go.","8800":"Excellent food and service !!\nHad a sandwich and a cappuccino !!\nHard to believe this delicious restaurant is located in a hospital.\n\nThank you\nJoe","4769":"My favorite pizza in Vegas. I always order the Mediterranean Salad add salami. Its always crisp, fresh ingredients & delicious vinaigrette dressing. A glass of Napa Cellars Chardonnay perfectly chilled. And a large meatball, ricotta, sundried tomato topped with fresh basil pizza so I always have leftovers to go. Absolutely, devine.","651":"$150 for 4 puppy training classes? I expected better. These classes are a waste of time and money. We spend a good 20 mins of that just chatting rather than working on training techniques. \n\nAlso, the customer service is terrible. \nI tried for 2 1\/2 weeks to reach them to book these classes. They are extremely difficult to reach. Never pick up the phone, never return messages or emails. \n\nHow can you do business like this? If it weren't for the fact they are the closest place to me that offer puppy training I wouldn't even bother with them. \n\nVery disappointing. If you want to get the most for your buck in puppy training, go elsewhere.","3766":"Well, wouldn't you know, I just wrote a review and now I get to enjoy one!  Delicious, peppery\/sweet, but not too sweet slaw.  Flavorful thinly sliced pastrami, just enough cheese and russian dressing.  I'm in heaven.","5527":"My first visit to this restaurant proved to be a huge mistake unfortunately. Extremely busy restaurant so obviously very popular. Chips and salsa and bean dip were all great. However 3 of a party of 6 ate the Shrimp ceviche; all three ended up with food poisoning and not only battled that miserable issue but were also forced to call out from their jobs while they recovered. A health and sanitation check is in order. Be warned!","3058":"I went to beyond donuts &cafe for the first time today and not knowing what they had I tried called 4 time from 12pm to 2pm to find out if they had a menu on line. I went ahead and went up there since no one was answering the phone only to find the placed closed. The doors were locked and no one was to be seen in the store. There were donuts on the display case and no sign on the door saying why they were closed. This was a horrible I wanted to try this place because I have heard good things about it and we'll I will not be going back.","509":"Lunch special is awesome.\nThe BBQ Chicken Pizza is the bomb.\n\nGina and Bruce, you need to get on Veebow. That's Valarie Bertinelli's company.","7637":"Scheduled a measurement for a dual pane glass insert replacement for a patio door.  I was told since I live close to their shop, the tech would arrive at 8am on Monday so i could get to work.  By 8:30 am, there is still no tech. I called the store and was told someone would arrive between 8 and 9 a.m.  By 9:15 a.m., no one arrived. I called back, was transferred someone else who said, There was a communication error. The tech is a on a job site. I guess I'm supposed to give you an ETA or offer to reschedule. The tech can't make it out until noon.  I was not even offered an apology. i had to burn an hour of vacation time waiting for someone who never arrived.  \n\nComplete waste of time and horrible customer service.  If there was a communication error on their end, my first call that morning should have resolved it. \n\nUse a company that is more respectful of your time. There are plenty of other glass companies in the Valley.","8964":"I will never return here. I came in on Wednesday and my partner and I were coldly ignored when we walked in yet all of the women and straight couples were warmly greeted. We spent twenty minutes looking around and no one would make eye contact with us yet the staff were falling over themselves to help everyone else. I'll be sure to share this experience with everyone I know. Avoid this place at all costs.","2413":"I only give this place 2 stars because I gave their neighbour Fantasy Swingers Club 1 star.  I suppose they should get an extra star because there were actually people at this club unlike their neighbour.\n\nWhile this place looks much nicer than the next door swingers club Fantasy I didn't bother wasting my money on this place either.  There were creepy guys hanging out front.  Just what a girl wants at the swingers club (rolls eyes)   The guy at the door was extremely rude and after being put off by Fantasy I was in no mood for bullshit.  You'd think for a place as dead as it was all but the creepy guys they'd be more friendly and inviting to get an attractive female through the doors.\n\nNot impressed with the Sins of Sin City!!","2983":"Great food and service.  Thanks especially to Morgan for making sure we were taken care of!","3927":"I stopped by while driving through town from back east. Just wanted a quick carwash to get the salt off of my car from driving in the snow. I read the signs and tried to take the antenna off of my car so it would not be damaged.  I was unable to remove it and asked the attendant Justin if he could help me. The attendant tried to unscrew the antenna and was unable to. Justin told me the antenna would be ok in the carwash as it was not retractable and had some, give. I asked if he was sure and he said, yeah, it'll be fine.  So I drive through and of course, my antenna gets ripped off the car.  I know I shouldn't expect much from a $5 car wash, but really?  When I came out of the carwash and showed the attendant, he said, Well, I've only worked here for a month. C'mon, seriously? Then maybe you shouldn't have told me it would be ok. I fill out an incident report and demand my $5 back. Got it. I was called after the manager called a dealership to check prices.  I was offered a $50 gift card for guess what, the carwash, or other services. Why the heck would I ever go back through that carwash?  Anyway, I told the manager the gift card was of no use to me as I do not live anywhere near the business. I was told at least I was getting more than 3 times what the antenna was worth. I still have to pay for the antenna, make an appointment and have it fixed on my time. The manager refused to send a check for even what the antenna was worth and said they were not responsible for the damage as there is a sign stating this in front of the carwash. I believe this sign is over ruled when you ask the attendant for help and are told the car will be fine. Very disappointed. Thanks for nothing. Do NOT go to this carwash no matter how quick or inexpensive it is. So much for customer service.","1739":"My experience with the Red Door Spa at 2502 East Camelback was a big disappointment!\nMy daughters had gone together to buy a package including a massage, a pedicure, and a manicure for Mother's Day.  \nThe massage person was very nice but the massage was superficial.  There was no attention to my body's needs. It was just done without thinking.\nThe pedicure and manicure by Raisa were the worst I have ever had! In fact, the very next day I went and had both redone in order to fix the problems she created! She was so worried about telling me about extra charges that she didn't focus on what she was doing!\nThe two women at the front desk were very nice as was the manager, Michelle, who called me after I filled out an emailed survey showing my unhappiness.\nMichelle said that the Red Door teaches protocols and in my opinion that is their downfall!  They need to trust their employees to offer individual customer service to meet individual needs!\nI was offered $56 towards my next services (if I go back it will be to a different location) and that was appreciated! However, the package cost in excess of $250.","6941":"Great beer list. Menu is on spot, food is good. The mild wing sauce is actually hot. Good but hot.","912":"This airport is the most frustrating airport I have ever had to travel through. On my last flight to YYC from Edmonton to connect to a US flight, I had two hours btwn flights. In most airports that would be more than enough time, but not Calgary. By the time I walked from terminal A to E (at least 15 mins and I arrived before the shuttles did) we were stuck waiting in security for over an hour before we had to go through customs. Why? They had one security line open for over 100 people in line trying to get through security and customs. By the time I got through both security and customs they were boarding my flight.  This is the third time this exact issue has happened and I won't be traveling through this airport again.  May be ok for domestic flights but think twice before you use it to transfer to the US, you may miss your flight. Good luck if you have mobility issues or small children traveling with you- add another hour to your transfer time!","894":"Had a fish salad and they smooshed it up into a tiny container.... fish was good but the salad container was too small, they even had trouble closing the lid...\n\nsister had Kalua tacos and the tortillas were cold even after going through the heater (???) Kalua pig was really salty even for Kalua pig\n\nI'd rather have chipotle tbh","137":"Having had Chinese food in India while growing up, we went with a lot of anticipation. Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.\n\nThe Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.\n\nThe service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.\n\nOur receipt invited us to share our experience at a Talk2us link, which only produced a survey error.\n\nHaving had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.","2974":"I have been to Black Dog 3 times in the last week if that says anything. I love their food, pretty much all of it. I get their ribs a lot but their burgers and sandwiches are hard to pass up. Don't forget to add on their sweet potato fries and their cornbread (the best cornbread I have ever had). Their other sides are very good but the sweet potato fries are so amazing its hard to pass them up. The chicken wings are possibly the best in town. All of the sauces are excellent, I highly recommend getting the sample sauce tray.\n\nDownside to this place is the wait but if you go early or late you generally only have to wait 15-20 minutes. I also suggest no more people than 4 as it is a very small place. The bar is a great place to sit so don't count it out.\n\nThe beer selection is excellent and I highly recommend the flight if you have some time (and a DD). The cocktails are so good and strong, just the way they should be! \n\nMy biggest wish is that they will open a second location in Downtown Champaign.","6356":"This is one of Pittsburgh's gems. It's one of those places tourists (and locals) discover and have to tell their friends about. It's unassumingly tucked behind a coffeeshop (Crazy Mocha) in Bloomfield, one of Pittsburgh's traditional neighborhoods. They specialize in all movies, but especially in foreign and independent. And if they don't have the movie you're looking for, they'll either get it, or you really don't need to see it, right? Anyway, stop in sometime and be delighted and amazed.","1313":"My visit here was great! I came for my first Brazilian($20 for new clients). I was a little scared but Edna made me feel a lot better. She has the best personality and will put you at ease. She'll talk to you throughout to distract from the pain. It did hurt but it was over quickly! I will definitely come back.","7089":"The food I've had here is pretty good but they have somethings to work out.\n\nThe biggest is the ordering process.  \n\nYou are handed a menu when you walk in and people stand around the line entrance figuring out what they want.  Once you know what you want, you can't just order it.  You have to walk through a hurried line where seemingly every person on the way asks you what you ordered or if you want what they have to offer.  You tell them what you want then at the end of the line, a disorganized pile of prepared dishes sits at the end of the line when you are again asked everything you ordered and expected to remember what the name of your sandwich, salad, or soup was called.\n\nI agree with the other reviewer about how stingy they are.  For me it was the upgrades that I have an issue with.  None of their soups come garnished.  Want tortilla strips on your tortilla soup?  That's an extra $.69.   A Tablespoon of orzo pasta in our tomato soup?  $.69 extra per scoop.\n\nAll in all, their food is good, but these issues make me go here 1 out of 10 times I think about it.  Throw the crazed parking that Camelback Colonade offers and it's just not worth it any more often than once every few months.","2391":"The salon is nice and inviting, has always been a pleasant experience.  Katie is a coloring master!  She definitely knows her stuff and I've always walked away from her cuts and colors a happy customer.  I know at least 20 other people who won't let anyone but Katie touch their hair...she's that good.  Highly recommend her!  Oh yeah, they have goodies to eat and drink while you're there, always appreciated. and some great jewelry...!","5983":"April 5\/13\nThree of us walked up here after the Jays game. We didn't have a reservation, and the place was jumping, but we got a seat very quickly. We don't know 'real' Korean BBQ from 'fake', but we did like this place. We liked the chicken and beef the best, but the squid is the most fun to cook! Get the veggies and pineapple rings for $3 a person - it really adds to the meal! We had the $9.95 each all-you-can-eat and left stuffed. The service was fine: friendly; prompt; helpful and cheerful. Tell them if you've never been before. They'll explain things and it helps. We'll be back with friends from out of town to show them a fun, late-night nosh!  (The premises were clean and we did not smell like BBQ when we left.).","5946":"Pretty much no complaints.  They were efficient, got things done, went above and beyond to make me happy, worked with me on my deductible... Just a very pleasant and professional experience.  Would definitely use them again.","5209":"Order:\n\n  - Golden Fried Calamari\n  - Large Pork Souvlaki\n  - Roasted Potatoes\n  - French Fries\n\nPrice:\n\nI found the price to be quite fair given the portion of my meal.  The prices seem pretty similar to other local Greek cuisine restaurants and given the quality, I would say the price is very reasonable.\n\nSize:\n\nI found the size of the meal quite large (which in my books is amazing!).  The Golden Fried Calamari was perfect for sharing and the main course, Pork Soulvaki with sides, was very filling.\n\nQuality:\n\nThe quality was exceptional.  The Golden Fried Calamari came out very quickly and tasted amazing with the Tzatziki sauce provided.  When the main course came around, I found the Pork Souvlaki a little dry however the roasted potatoes tasted great!  This was the first time I experienced the dry Pork Souvlaki as prior visits left my mouth craving for more as each piece of meat was usually well cooked, tender and you could really taste the cinnamon spices applied to the meat; this really complimented the meal.\n\nOverall:\n\nI will be returning to this restaurant whenever I am in the mood for Greek and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving the same cuisine in Vaughan!","3351":"The food was well prepared and fresh. Service was slow enough that it almost cost them a star.","6277":"First time visit.  Had the trio .  Was good lots of cheese !  Came with fresh salad and housemade rolls.  Portion was generous.  There was a lot of people picking up takeout.  Popular place.  Nice service..  The menu had quite of few things to choose from and great pricing too.  \n\nThis will be our favorite place to go for Italian now !","4385":"Well this place is great. Fish and chips are always fresh and crispy. Chose cod or halibut ,,, either is good. They also have the most amazing burgers!  The waffle burger is out of this world!","3001":"Great for groups (9 of us), awesome food...we all ordered separate things and every one loved their food. Real winners were the sin city burger, brussel sprouts, and my strawberry margarita. Also, our friend got 50% off his meal this month for having his name start with a T! Wait staff was awesome and the interior is fun to look at! Will be back again!","7411":"So I scheduled an appointment for wedding dress shopping 2 months in advanced as I needed to be certain I could get a specific day and time as I had family flying in to go shopping with me. Making the appointment was super easy. The week of my appointment I was called by an employee stating my appointment needed to be moved to an earlier time slot as they double booked my appointment time. I explained that I could not move as my family wouldn't be in town at that time. She became irritated with me and said fine and ended the phone call. So my appointment rolls around and I have a girl to help who is very unenthusiastic and is split between me and another bride. There were only us 2 brides there at the time; the store really couldn't have a manager cover one of the hour and half appointments?? Needless to say, I spent a lot of time standing around waiting for my girl to come back to me. I decide on a dress and make the purchase. Fast forward 6 months to my alterations appointment. The initial went well however they charge you for every single little thing. I then scheduled my pick up appointment 4 weeks out. 2 days prior to that appointment a woman calls me stating and employee is out with a broken foot and that there is no way that my dress will be ready by the said date. So my appointment was pushed out another 2 weeks!!! And when looking at a day when I was available the woman was very irritated that I couldn't just come in the day and time she picked and had to search for one that worked with my work schedule. So the day of my pick up has arrived and I sat and waited in the fitting room for 20 minutes while they looked for my dress. Then they bring it to me and it's not complete!! The sash isn't sewed on as it should be. Paola stated it fell off and they'd finish it today. The seamstress came out, who is a sweet lady, and helped show me the bushel. She then took my dress back to sew and steam and asked if I could come back tomorrow or if I wanted to wait. Well I waited as I wasn't going to drive an hour round trip out of my way again tomorrow. I would not recommend this store to anyone!! They charge you an arm and leg and can't even deliver on their end. They are far from professional and you won't have a pleasant experience here.  The only reason for the 2 stars rather than one is that the seamstress was very nice, professional, and apologetic.","3841":"This place is awesome..!!!! Great service, great food!!! I had salmon-skin salad n yaki Udon..!!!","7207":"Love this CVS Store! Customer service is great and they are so friendly and courteous. I have used the Minute Clinic and highly recommend this service also.","2820":"Best car wash my car has ever received! My car was a mess & needed a lot of help. Thomas literally left my car looking brand new. It's also clear he uses great products to clean, because my leather is still shining from the conditioner.","264":"My first experience there was when Jellyfish was in its second week. It wasn't packed and we had a small meal with my boyfriend because we had to get to a concert. Since that time we always mentioned to go back there to actually enjoy it in a more relaxed manner. I wish we did not! The restaurant is full, food and service do not impress you at all. For food we ordered the crab bao, cod and charcoal carrots. First the crab came and we thought that it was okay but a bit too fried. Then there were the cod and charcoal carrots. Cod's top was literally burnt. I love Jatoba and their cod melts in your mouth. Compared to that eating at Jellyfish was an awful experience. We asked for bread three times. The first one the server forgot, the second time the bread went to the table behind us and in the third time we were already done with the food. At least the server brought it because after eating the cod and the carrots I was sick and needed something to keep me from getting worser until I got home. After the bread we paid and quickly got home to rest. What an end to the night... Besides enjoying the ambiance wouldn't recommend it at all","3885":"It seems like just a head-shop, but the reason I go into places like this is mostly for novelties and incense... I got my fill here. (: They had the cheapest prices on incense around, awesome blacklight posters, and lots of tobacco options, even though I only purchased incense, sage, and some bumper stickers. It has a nice ambiance. If you have never been there before and you are thinking of going.. do it.. and be sure to look up at the ceiling when you walk in.","9044":"Service was very friendly and fast. The food, though, was excellent. The omelette is served pancake style but one of the better omelettes I have had. I doubt I will ever eat breakfast in one of the casinos again. As hard as it is to screw up breakfast, most casino restaurants find a way. Since my guys and I are in Vegas twice a year for trade shows, we decided this is our new breakfast spot.","7190":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????","627":"Waited 20 minutes, apparently on fries. All tables that came in after got their food first, with fries. But at least we got our bill, yet again, before our food. At least 6 staff, manager included, just standing around. Left without food.","8433":"worst customer service ever, Do NOT buy anything from this store, There Geek are really are Geek , item come damage geek do not know what they doing, Store rep give you the run around, pricing maybe good but you will get upset at the end, why shop there when Micro center around the corner.\nTry calling the store you will spend hours on hold, this place should be closed and all the looser that work there should be out of a job.\nNot worth your time if you must shop in best buy and I don't know why anyone will do that, do it online save yourself the aggravation of dealing with those people.","4485":"It is an interesting concept with decent presentation. We ordered the cheese trio, salmon salad,carpaccio and veggie pizza. \n\nNot mentioning the portion is small but taste is rather dull and repetitive. I feel I got ripped off for dishes I can make myself by buying quality ingredients from an organic market. \n\nnot recommended.","7860":"Used to love netfirms and I've been with them for 10 years.  However, they were purchased by the EIG group a couple of years ago and not longer has the same service standards.\n\nIn fact, they are partnered with sitelock (another arm of EIG group) and combined, it feels like they blackmail you into subscribing to the sitelock service.\n\nI've subscribed to sitelock and still; they've called me 3 times in the past year trying to upsell.\n\ngoogle sitelock scam netfirms for more info.\n\nWould not suggest it anymore","9069":"Very cool atmosphere and I loved the booth seating.  The mac & cheese and the cornbread are a must-get.  My prime rib was about a 7 on a 10 scale (a little dry), but everyone else at the table raved about their dinners and the rotisserie chicken was a 9+.  Will definitely be back.","3629":"The sandwiches are creative, fresh and tasty ... sometimes a bit juicy for elegant eating, but hey, most of the time the place is full of students, and students don't take time for elegance, no?  The free cookie is nice, the no refills soda policy is not.  Prices are fair.  \nBut the place is LOUD.  Uncomfortably so.  It's not the music, or even the conversation level ... it's that there is not one soft surface in the place, and sound amplifies as it bounces off glossy walls, counters, tables and floors.  It's designed that way, and lord knows why. \nThe sandwiches and salads make up for it, though.","3081":"I can't recommend A  Body In Balance enough. Matt is an awesome coach and Debbie at the front desk is very welcoming. When I first came to a A Body In Balance I\ncouldn't even get up from a chair without pushing off,my hips hurt constantly, I didn't\nknow what an ab was, now I get up and down with ease my hips don't hurt and I have abs for the first time in my life.

Very nice service, clean place only thing I was looking for chips but 5 stars","5720":"Coming from the east coast, this is my first stop every time I visit the west coast. Burgers are super fresh. I love the animal sauce.","6236":"Food was very good, I had the street tacos and my girlfriend had the Mahi tacos. We ordered a margarita, Very good. You get free flan with a Yelp check in and it was very good. The service was amazing, the whole experience was topped off by wonderful customer service by the general manager! All in all a great experience. I will be back.","2564":"I ate here last night about 8:30pm with my fianc\u00e9. We had been here once before and it seems they have renovated so the place looks way better. They now also serve you a free appetizer of shrimp chips with peanut satay sauce, which is delicious!\n\nWe ordered the 4 pieces of spring rolls as an app, and they were tasty. The dipping sauce seems to be honey with mirin; it's good.\n\nI had the Tamarind Duck: yum! Nothing to complain about. Crispy pieces of sliced duck on top of crispy noodles topped with a few sliced veggies in a tangy and savoury tamarind sauce. They serve a tiny salad on one corner of the dish which I had no desire of eating, but only because I didn't come for salad and I'm not a salad person.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had their Red Curry, and it was very tasty and had a good heat to it. We like eating spicy food and find most restaurants keep their spicy dishes pretty mild.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, it's very relaxing and calm. The service is great, and the servers will take time to explain anything you may have questions about. They are also very friendly.\n\nI will definitely be returning any time I have a craving for Thai!","1562":"Tania did an incredible job with my eyebrows after only my first appointment! For months I had been going to different threading places, and I was never truly happy with the result.\nTania was the first person who really took the time to ask me what I wanted and to explain me what would look good on my face. AND I LOVED THE RESULT! \nTania is an artist. I definitely recommend her!","5219":"I love Zen! Everything about it is wonderful. The location, the staff, there service, even the music.

This guy knows his craft and I look for him specifically when ever I'm in town for a conference. His number is 702-602-2535 and I think he works Sat-Tues 9-6.\n\nWarning you may need to endure the front desk staff of the CanyonRanch Spa who are a bit of a pain in the arse. Its worth it if you have the patience. Best to just go hang out by the barber shop which just past the front desk on the left.","108":"Stay away from this company. You are paying for their advertising budget. They are more than double compared to any legitimate, reputable floor specialist in the Phoenix.\nWe had an appointment with Express Flooring just now. It was totally unprofessional from the minute the sales person came through the door. We were actually embarrassed for her. When we questioned her sales technique, she told us  she has to follow a certain sales interview protocol,  to us at our mature age it seemed rude and inappropriate. Besides the sales pitch, the material was sub par well below the quality for laminate found at big box stores. We were absolutely shocked at the price given to us  to close the sale today! It was over double!! They are a joke, don't believe their advertising, Don't waste your time, we are sorry we did.  The rating should be 0.","8633":"One star for the I really don't give a damn attitude of the staff at check in.\n\nI made a reservation and questioned the agent extensively about the pool as my 9 year old son was going to be with me.  I knew part of the pool area was topless from previous visits but being an adult it didn't matter to me. I made sure he could use part of it, play under the waterfalls etc.  Sounded great and I made the reservation.\n\nUpon arrival TWO days after making the reservation I was told upon check in that the pool was CLOSED for the season.  The front desk person appeared not to care.  I said the ONLY reason we had chosen to stay there was because of the pool.  They would not move me to another property that had a pool or let me cancel my reservation.\n\nI was mad and still am.\n\nYeah, the rooms were clean.  We all know that by suite the Rio really means big room.  Not a room with a separate bedroom and living area.  Whatever.  \n\nThis was not my first time to stay here but I feel it was my last.  It's amazing how just one poor employee can ruin it for a business.","4633":"5 stars for the value at this joint. 50 things under 7$ several under 5$. Breakfast here rules. If your on a budget this is the spot, and the food's good either way.","6823":"Pretty hotel, terrible service (as in none whatsoever) at the pool. The one waitress basically ignored us the entire time even when we approached her to try and place a drink and food order.","2315":"I use to LOVE Armstrong's.  I had been going there since they opened, even driving from the north hills to have dinner there.  Some where along the way, in the last few years, Armstrong's has lost its way.  The last few times I went there, the food was not good, but the most disappointing was the service.  Terrible.  The main reason I always like going there was the fast and reliable server and bartender.  I waited long for her to greet us, close to fifteen minutes-almost left.  Then she never came back to ask if I wanted another drink and brought the bill. A shame, because I'm a huge tipper, 25-30% - I use to be a server.  I sadly will never go back, it seems that they aren't hurting for business because there really isn't any competition close by, and people who live by just remember the way it use to be and the servers are nice to their regulars.","8849":"After informing the waitress of my time restriction it took her 15 minutes to even come to the table and take our order. The ramen I had was beyond gross. The noodles were extremely overcooked, the meat had no taste and the broth was disgustingly bland and flavorless. I've had the sushi here before and it was ok, but this experience has given me reason to never go back.\n\nI eat a lot of ramen and this was by far the worst I've ever had. I left 95% of the bowl untouched and still paid for it. Never again...","298":"really good pork banh mi and veggie pho! it's hard to find vegetarian food around here but the tofu pho is really decent. the pork banh mi stands up to most Vietnamese sandwich shops I've been to in the US.","1247":"Macs is my go-to for comfort food. I absolutely love this place. The selection isn't huge, but they always have what I'm craving. \n\nI was just here with my inlaws and some of their friends from PA. Apparently, we've convinced them this is one of THE places to go for food when in the valley. And I couldn't agree more. I absolutely love their fish sandwich. It's one of the few that is grilled and not fried. \n\nTheir French Fries are the perfectly addicting kind of shoe strings and their rotating selection of craft beers keeps it interesting. Their mixed drinks are a bit of a crap shoot- not a fan of their macarita. \n\nPlus, as a local establishment, they keep things local. For example, this week is AZ beer week and when we ordered the Huss beer (another one of our local favs), the Huss beer rep came over to thank us personally for ordering their beer, gave us some free Huss swag and talked to us a bit about beer and running (a personal hobby that she overheard while I was eating dinner). \n\nMacs is the kind of place that makes you feel like a local and that you belong there. It's my cheers. Don't worry, I won't start singing...but I'm tempted.","3627":"Went for lunch. Pretty hip place. Not the best service, but the decor is interesting and the presentation was right on. I tried the lamb burger. It tasted 100% lamb. I usually prefer some sausage in the grind to cut the gamey taste, but it was cooked well nonetheless. Can't wait to go back in the evening and sample the cocktails. There are table seats and then there's an L-shaped bar area that looks like it would be cool for after dinner. I shalst see....","402":"This review isn't about the food because we didn't get to taste it.  We waited in line with a bunch of other people.  It was to open at 4:30 pm and at 4:45 pm were rudely told that it was closed for a private party.  They should have posted a courtesy notice on the door.","4528":"I used to consider this THE place to go. The food, while good, cannot make up for the really, really lousy service. On a recent visit at lunch, my date and I sat at the empty bar. The bartender and manager completely ignored us. After 7 minutes or so, another gentleman sat at the bar. Another 5 minutes went by. Then the other guy got served. Waiting patiently, again ignored. The worst experience ever! I will never set foot in this establishment again. We left without eating.","5322":"I had terrible experiences with previous hairdressers and thought I would try this salon because the reviews were so good. I came in with damaged hair looking like it had been cut with a weed whacker and Micheal transformed it into a healthy looking doo. With my wedding coming up I did not want much cut off ... and he listened and did a fabulous job. Thank you Micheal. I will be back! \n(on a side note: I hope you find Ty and hire her on)","4267":"Eric is one of the best. He knows the business of RV repair.  And if he don't, he will direct you to one that does.  He is very experienced in RV repair. I would highly recommend E's RV for anything you need repaired on your RV.  My first call to him sold me.  I could tell he knew his business.  When I need a repair, he is the one I will call.","291":"The staff here were very friendly! I had a free drink on my card and the barista gave me a suggestion of something to add to my drink, too! Awesome job! \n\nI think out of all the Starbucks locations I've been to in Charlotte, this and East Blvd are my favorite locations.","8288":"Probably the best meal I've had in Calgary in a long time. Everything was absolutely delicious especially the french fries and hollandaise sauce, cauliflower fritters and the bread pudding!!! Gabby took great care of us! Such great service. Love love love Bistro Rouge!","4505":"Trader Joe's has the best food. We love not having to worry about the ingredients being GMO, having preservatives or any other bad fillers. This store has everything we need for our family at the best prices. Wish there was a Trader Joe's out near Higley in Gilbert. We drive 20 minutes but worth the time~~","3223":"Had great expectations for this restaurant and was highly disappointed.  Arrived early and sat in the lounge.  My husband had to go to the bar to get drinks for us since the server was nowhere to be found and never acknowledged our presence.  I had a mojito and there was no visible mint in my drink.  WTH!  Was seated at our table at the time of our reservation. The server told us that we could NOT order an appetizer first, that we must order our entire meal to include wine at one time, end of discussion.  Okay we make our choices and order about 10 minutes later.  Still no bread.  Wait about 15 minutes for appetizers, they are brought.  Then finally some bread is brought out.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the olives and they were meh!  The warm bread was covered in salt, so much so that my husband the sodium freak said it was too much for him.  I had the shrimp with spaghetti while my spouse had the lamb.  My pasta was clumpy and overcooked as were the two shrimp I received with it.  My husband's lamb was ordered medium rare and was received as  well done.  Both appetizers lacked seasoning and we were not offered any  parmesan for the pasta or salt\/pepper for any of our food.  On a side note, the portions are incredibly  small.  My sister lives in Vicenza Italy and I thave traveled there on a frequent basis for the past 30 years, 3-4 times a year and this is not Italian food or service.  The waiter asked how we were enjoying our meal and we told him.  No one from management approached us.  We did not order dessert because the majority of it appeared dried out.  My husband did order coffee for after dinner.  This was a total waste of our time and money.","129":"The House is just how it sounds. It is amazing that Matt Carter(Zinc Bistro and Mission) continues to evolve. So comforting and service was amazinng, especially considering it has only been open a few weeks. King crab and smoked gouda fondue! Roasted Halibut! and the Lamb Bolognese was suprisinglyreally good, the lemon marscopone and mint worked fantastically! Patio is amazing weather permitting.","7349":"My husband like this barber shop. The cut was nicely done. The service was excellent, hot face towel and massage machine after the cut. The machine was interesting. It is strapped on the barber's hand but very effective.","5326":"I've only tried their burgers but man are they good. \n\nThe poutine is amazing. \n\nOur server, Amanda, was a gem! Knows her beer. Love her!","5329":"Sight unseen the manager offered to replace my Dunham boots over a year old.\nGreat service.","6582":"Receptionist was an older lady..looking up over her glasses to answer me in a  rude and dismissive way. .Acted as if I was begging for a free service.Quite condescending and borderline arrogant.I guess it is empty for a reason.\nWent around the corner to Vince's Hair Style.Much better !!!!!!","8487":"Great food, great service!  We usually order this Spinach and Argula salad and the meatball subs, but everything on the menu is delicious!  Service is fast and staff is always friendly.","4756":"well..  I wanted to like it..but....\n\nThe server was a mess.  Got something on everyone of our table of 5's meal wrong...literally.\n\nDraft beer was flat.\n\nGot the brisket.  Was nice and tender but it taste like it was cooked in the oven!! Not a hint of smokiness.  Mac and cheese was not good...almost pastey consistency.  Baked beans were different but good.\n\nOne at our table ordered the boneless babybacks..but got regular... server was supposed to fix it.... 15 min later came back and said it wouild be another 10 min....  needless to say he ate the bone-ins.\n\nTook forever to get the food then forever for the server to come back and bring the check.  And of course....checks were screwed up and wrong amounts charged to cards (and that was for the correctly calculated check) \n\nNext time in Cleveland I will skip BBQ.","2818":"Whenever I feel like I'm coming down with something, I go get their Then Tuk, which is the Tibetan version of a chicken noodle soup.  But oh, the noodle is fresh and handmade, with a satisfying texture and consistency; the soup is a nice rich broth with spinach to make you feel even more virtuous.  I ask for some extra spice to, which gives it a good kick and clears away anything ick that may be in the sinuses!\n\nAlso, really like the friendly folks who run the place.  It's low-key, very reasonable prices and pretty good food all around.","5892":"We just love it here~Been coming since day one and every week we look forward to our next time there~Ramon has the best everything~","4117":"Food is amazing! I have gotten it many times and every time I get my food fast and it is always tasty","1813":"Great atmosphere! My friend from SoCal visited last weekend and we had some food and drinks. Little slow on getting our tab paid from staff. As a former New Mexico resident I will be back, love that you have my Hatch green chile and would recommend this to any of my New Mexico friends and family.","41":"Only gave 2 stars, because when I mentioned Military discount the lady behind the register looked at me like I was crazy, she said no discounts here, we don't even get employee discounts REALLY, !!! Employee discounts !!. I did more for this country in Iraq, than that lady will do her life at the restaurant, Your welcome lady !!!! I think she could of been a little more appreciative.","4060":"This is an awesome and friendly place with a great service. I started to go see Linda for electrolysis and in 6 months she succeeded where the previous place I was going tried for 2 years! She s professional and kind. I highly recommend this salon!","1160":"I went in last night with my family for Taco Tuesday and loved every minute of my dinner. $2 delicious tacos and great drink specials. We also ordered the mini chimis and nachos and both came out hot and tasted amazing. The drink menu was really interesting and creative, and the Margarita was perfect. My server was knowledgeable and attentive. I have zero complaints about this place and would recommend it to everyone, old and young!","1317":"Placed order online.  Waited.  Never got product.  Would check status online at their website and it would just say open.  Any time you call you get same recorded message saying Due to high volume of phone calls we cannot answer but please leave a message and someone will call you back.  Left message and no one called me.  Finally sent email to their sales staff email and got a message back they could not get an eta on my order so they were just going to cancel it.  What a bunch of total bs.","6072":"Antoinette, \n\nIs professional, knowledgeable & trustworthy! \nShe is definitely someone that you can rely on. \nWent above & beyond to accommodate my schedule. I would absolutely recommend her to all my family & friends & to all of you that needed\nService from her. Thanks Antoinette!","4383":"Went in this morning, waited forever as the stylists chatted at length without barely cutting their clients hair.  The loud tvs made the wait unbearable.","7930":"Probably the best Boba I have ever had...Ever. \n\nIt's super convenient, in the same block as the gym, and super quick. \nThere is also so much variety, that I like to choose something new every time I go! \nThe owner is wonderful, and the place looks very chill. \nVery great, would recommend it to any bubble tea lover like myself (:","7018":"Awsome food and very clean decor. Caution parking can be hard to find when Stampeders are playing","599":"LOVE: Food! Everything soooho good! \nLIKE: staff is soho amazing! I've had the pleasure of being served by I think Louie twice, he's so awesome. But the whole staff helps out as a team to make the experience top notch! \nDISLIKE: nothing!","8011":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  Excellent food and Excellent Service!  We have already been back a few times and will definitely keep this in our rotation!!  Our next stop is RUE 21!!!","127":"I ate here for the first time the other day. I was a bit nervous that it'd be busy because it was a Sunday morning but there were still spots in their baby parking lot. Their drive thru is poorly placed for other drivers trying to park but their ordering system makes the line go pretty quickly. My friend and I ate on the patio. They was plenty of seating outside but little seating inside. The food and drinks were great! I had a breakfast croissant sandwich and an orange glorious smoothie. \n\nAll in all the restaurant is appropriately named. The food and drinks are indeed d'lish.","46":"I must say the place is average and location sketchy but what made the whole experience wonderful was a kind cocktail waitress named Beatrice. Beatrice was more than welcoming and professional. She made sure we were treated like VIPs. The whole bachelor party would return for Beatrice! She deserves a raise or great tips!","5567":"I get my gel manicure done every two weeks, and I generally hop from place to place trying to find the perfect salon to be a regular at; unfortunately, this is certainly not a place I will ever go again. \n\nAs soon as I walked into the salon, everyone was smiling and friendly. When I asked if I could get a gel manicure, they called me back to a little area where nails were done. Angela shook my hand and was very pleasant. She introduced herself as my nail technician, and said she would take care of me. \n\nI took a look at her polish selection. She had roughly fifteen regular nail polishes, a few varnishes, and about five gel colors. That day, I was set on white for my Birthday. If she didn't have white, I knew that I would need to leave. When I explained that I was really hoping for white, she stated that she could grab one from a beauty store next door. It was extremely sweet, and she totally went out of her way for me to be happy. We talked and cracked jokes as she took off my polish, soaked my hands, and started the process. \n\nEverything seemed great, but as soon as she started setting my nails under the lights, something was off. The white nail polish was wrinkling. She noticed it first, stating that it was most likely the nail polish itself. Taking time to take off the polish and try it again, I really appreciated the effort she put in to make it right. When all was said and done, my nails looked pretty good after two and a half hours of me sitting in that chair. It was definitely the most I've ever spent on just a gel manicure. $45, not including the tip. To me, though, it seemed worth it because she worked so hard to make things right. \n\nA day and a half later, (on my Birthday), my nails started acting funky. The tips turned a brownish\/orange-ish color and started cracking. I wasn't sure what was going on, but I knew it wasn't anything I had done. I called Angela to let her know what was happening, but she didn't answer. I texted her after that to advise her of my current situation, and although I and I asked for a refund, I let her know that I didn't think it was a reflection of her as an artist or a person. Gel nails are supposed to last at least two weeks, though, and I thought she would understand; unfortunately, she stated I couldn't get a refund due to the fact that she thought it was just the nail polish itself, and never texted me back. I also called the establishment to speak with the owner, but nobody answered. I took the extension number for the owner and called her a few times, but she never picked up, so I just took this one as a loss. \n\nTo me, this was the worst nail experience I've ever had. I'm typically a VERY happy-go-lucky human being, and I accept that everyone makes mistakes. But because I've been working in the Customer Service industry for years, I know what's acceptable and what isn't. This wasn't great customer service. This was the bare minimum. \n\nThis place is called It's All About U. Perhaps it is....\nThat is, until they messed up. Then It's All On U.","1653":"Absolutely horrible! !! Waited 3 hours to see the doctor. The reception is ghetto and needs to find another job. No respect for their patients.  They make you wait 3 hours to see the doctor. Don't go!! Didn't want to pick a star but you have too.","2381":"Rip's has become our favorite neighborhood bar for a few reasons.  The first and most important being Karaoke.  There's a reason it was voted best in the valley (New Times '11).  Karaoke is usually pretty terrible, but not at Rip's - the host, Jen, is a great host and singer.  And the other singers vary in skill, but the crowd is always supportive.  Drinks are usually pretty cheap, and all the bartenders are great - the kind that like to know your name.  Obscura is not a typical night for Rip's, but is an AWESOME dance night.  Stop by Rip's any day for a good time.","7201":"We love this place! Back for a second time last night in the past two weeks. Had a great first experience so we decided to go back. It's also nice to bump into friends from the neighborhood when we're there. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, dimmed lights and candles on the table. The staff is awesome, very attentive and friendly. We had the pleasure of having Kaela the rock star take care of us both nights :) We forgot to mention our pine nut allergy before ordering, and the staff made sure to let us know what our entr\u00e9e contained, just to make sure. A few things we have had to eat was the Curry Chicken lollipops, Goat Cheese Flat bread and the Lardon Poutine. All were very yummy. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their amazing food. We have definitely found our new spot in the neighborhood.","2439":"This review is for the Grill at the Gold Spike.  We just finished having a late breakfast here, and I couldn't be happier with our choice.  Our server, Angelina, was so incredibly friendly and patient with our questions, and make absolutely sure that all of our food was compliant with our various dietary restrictions.  She was attentive and funny, and you would be lucky to have her as your server.!  Also, the chef, Don, even came out of the kitchen to talk to us and make sure that the dish would come out exactly like we wanted it.   Awesome service by both of them!!  The food is really good as well, a great alternative to the myriad of greasy, fried, fatty, bloating options in the area.  Try the steak loin salad, it's delicious and won't make you feel like you need a nap after.  Prices are more than fair for what you get as well.  For a relaxed breakfast\/lunch spot with great service and healthier options, definitely give The Grill a shot!","5530":"This place is small and looks like no one makes an effort to wipe up tables or straighten chairs. My mocha slush is so powdery and artificial tasting. My boyfriends passion fruit green tea tastes like cleaning solution and I can smell it just sitting next to him. All I can say is wtf!","8280":"This company is great. I have called and in 30 minutes they came to repair my phone screen. My iPhone 6 glass was replaced in less than 20 minutes He also installed a tempered glass screen protector on it. I also had IPad 2 glass that was cracked and he fixed that too on the spot in about an hour. But it doesn't stop here, these guys also fix Galaxy and LG phones. My sister had her LG G3 completely destroyed, the screen was just black, we thought its done, but he came back with a new Lcd for it and in an hour my sister's LG was like brand new, we were shocked. And to put a cherry on top we gave him my dad's Galaxy s 4 that just had cracked glass, and he put a new glass on it as well. He gave us discounts, since we had so much devices to fix, and we were thrilled. And the best part all of his work comes with warranty. I have called another guy on yelp and he wanted to charge more in order to include warranty. Don't look anywhere else, this is your one company for all your phones and tablet problems. Thank you so much Funny o Useful 1 Cool 0 Compliment a Activity Nearby Search More","6437":"Lee Lee's.... the fresh fish, shellfish, poultry, pork and the prepared foods are reminiscent of my Hawai'ian home. Wish they had more local kine stuff like laulau, poi and lomi salmon but at least had Aloha brand shoyu and sauces! Nice selection of Hawaiian Sun frozen juice concentrate but not too much canned drinks. \n\nLots of Indian, Middle Eastern, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese foods, spices and condiments. Too bad the Chinese charcuterie roasting duckling, pork and chicken was closed on my visit. But the fishy, stinky smells coming from the seafood tanks and poultry\/meat counters are the best! I'm home again.","6407":"Lucked out and didn't have to wait long for a table of 2. We had a gyoza to start and I had the Tonkotsu Black Ramen with a sapparo. The broth was delicious with the black oil+garlic flavor. Perfect! For a cold day.  The noodles weren't over cooked which is very important IMO.","1457":"Any aches or pains??? Lena will fix you up! She's diligent with finding your problem and helping to relieve your pain. She's funny and gives homework stretching.\n\nWould definitely book again, when I'm Charlotte!","5158":"It's a nice atmosphere and service is not bad. I enjoyed the first time I was there so I decided to buy the Living Social deal for a brunch back in October 2014. I was excited to use it but due to work and travel the coupon reached the expiration date. They refused to take the coupon after expiry even though newer\/exact same deal was on via LivingSocial. I left a voicemail with the manager who never contacted me. I may have lost the $35, but sadly, I don't feel like supporting a business that doesn't appreciate repeated customers. My advise to those buying these deals: make sure you can stick to the reservation before the coupon expiration date. Cibo will not budge. You can however use the face value anytime. But then again will I really be excited to use the expired coupon just so I can get my money back? I will be happier at so many other deserving restaurants that offer great food and service.","1532":"This place is terrible.  We had just arrived in Vegas and were thinking about eating at Joe's Stone Crab or Planet Hollywood.  Both were packed, but PJ Clarke's looked pretty empty.  We looked it up on Yelp and found that it had decent ratings so we decided to give it a try.  \n\nConsidering the place only had a few patrons and that it was mid week around 9pm, we thought we would get served immediately.  The hostess was nice and brought us to our table.  The atmosphere seemed OK, but the wait was ridiculous.  We made eye contact with 3 different waiters and smiled assuming they would come over and help us, but they just ignored us.  It looked deliberate as it seemed they were about to come over, but instead just kept talking.  We couldn't believe it.\n\nNow I understand we weren't dressed formally, but I was with my wife and mom and we were just dressed casually (khakis and shirts, nothing too fancy, but nothing bizarre either).  It seemed as if we were being discriminated against for whatever reason as they didn't even greet us for 20 minutes.  We tried to get their attention, but they just kept pretending to ignore us.  In fact I'm not even sure if it was just us as the table next to us seemed to be getting pretty slow service as well.  It was really strange because we were the only two tables on that side of the establishment and there were only about 2 other tables occupied on the opposite side.  We continued to wait......and NOTHING!!!\n\nWe decided to get up and leave.  The hostess approached us and asked what happened and we told her that we were ignored and nobody approached us to take our order.  Again she was nice and tried to call one of them but even that took a while so we just walked out and went to Planet Hollywood (good meal and good service).\n\nRegardless we are not going back to PJ Clarke's again and recommend that nobody else does either.","717":"The space is huge and I like the concept of ordering from the ipad, instead of checking off a piece of paper which is usually the case at most all you can eat places. \nThe sashimi isnt bad and the rest of the menu is pretty mediocore. I did not enjoy the sushi rolls at all.\nThere was 2 of us and we ordered a sake as well..the bill came to about $75. For the amount of food we actually ate, it was an expensive bill which could have been cheaper at a regular sushi restaurant.","3570":"Lunch specials are awesome value, quick service, great food","2809":"I really am a fan of this place. It has good food and good beer, and also is associated with some good memories here. This place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two. Or in our case, a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game. The parking here can be difficult since there is no lot or anything designated for costumer parking. The beer is really good here. I like the lighter beers, such as their regular peach beer, but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too. The food is delish; I always get a hankering for their beer battered fries. Eat it with their jalape\u00f1o ranch sauce and it's perfect. That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge. It's really an awesome spot to get together with friend, have a pint, enjoy a game and some good food.","5751":"The show was a little over an hour long.  Half of that hour was watching them eat Twinkies ... no REALLY... and the other half they made a HUGE mess on the stage, of which I don't even know what they were trying to do.  \n\nThe music sucked, oh, and we got TP'd in the beginning.  I don't know about you, but I'm not really cool with spending $100 bucks just to get TP'd\n\nReally the only reason why I watched this show was because I got to go to Madame Tussaud's for free for buying the ticket.  I thought 2 shows for the price of 1.. so cool! .... WRONG!!  Madame Tussaud, on the other hand, was excellent.  You should stay as far away from this show as possible.  You should skip the double feature bullshit and pay the $35 to go to JUST Madame Tussaud's instead of being a cheap ass like me.","53":"Great Japanese food. Make sure you go a bit earlier as there's always a queue. We waited for 15-20 minutes on the latest visit but you could see the turn around time inside the restaurant was quick and the service was ON it with the many staff working there. We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl. All were great and well made, well balanced dishes.\n\nI would call this Japanese fusion. No sushi is served here. Service was quick. Not the place to go for a long chatty meal.","328":"Cute dance studio! Very organized staff and we'll run programs. My daughter loved ballet and really enjoyed performing in their annual recital.","1848":"I love going to Guy Fieri's local hand picked spots....Hands down my favorite place for beer and pretzels. Love, love, love, the horseradish for dipping and you cant get upset with a place that serves 32oz beers. The glasses are bigger than my head. I can never finish it. My love and I made an appearance here on date night last week, so our dining was casual with drinks. Bradford was our server. He was fantastic. They close at 9 during the week but, were good sports and stayed open until we were finished with our drinks. Bradford invited us back on the weekend for live bands (which Joe and I LOVE.) Love going here great service, great people, great food.","8295":"The best pizza place in Oregon. The smell of pizza when you open the door is awesome, reminds me of my child hood going to the local ma & pa pizza parlors. Limited choices on beer (Miller Lite & Bud Light) but the pitchers are cheap. The service is great.","4770":"Junk King was fast, reliable, friendly with reasonable rates. They also use a unique truck bed cover to help prevent any cash from flying out.\n\nI would use them again.","6986":"What a relief.  \n\nGot used to the trash that KFC puts out two blocks away.\n\nFinally a place that does it right.  Ordered a Family Dinner and it was great.  Even three days later the left over chicken was good.\n\nOnly issue not giving 5 stars is the corn on the cob had been sitting there a while.  Tried to give it to the dogs and even they turned away - just does not happen virtually ever.","3967":"This is probably one of the WORST pizza places around Vegas and there's a lot.  I'm from Jersey, so I KNOW a little something about good pizza! I've ordered from Maestro's many times before and have always gave them the benefit of the doubt, but how could a pizza place really mess up a plain cheese pizza?! I ordered for delivery multiple times and the pizza ALWAYS comes cold, tissue-thin uncooked dough, and the taste is soooo bland! EVERY TIME!! They really like to get more of YOUR bang for your buck by watering down condiments which they charge an arm and a leg for and thinning out the dough so much, all you get is overly-processed cold toppings. I really have had it with this place. They just get more and more worse. NO MORE. BEWARE. Digiorno offers better pizza than this place! Geesh!","5032":"The food is beyond good it is absolutely great. You can taste the quality products they use in their menu selections. I've never had anything bad from Soul food on Hamilton.\nMy husband holds business meetings there so he can introduce people to good soul food...since my husband is from Florida he use to complain about not have a good soul food restaurant around in Pittsburgh. \nThe owners are very nice and I just adore Ms. Mimi she recognizes my voice when I call for take out orders she even ask my husband about our babies when he's there....yes, I was sitting at this restaurant 5 days after delivering my youngest baby lol that's how good this place is.\nI forgot to mention this place is very CLEAN and the prices are awesome.\n\nIf you are in Pittsburgh and want good authentic soul food please check this place out they will not disappoint.  By the way the chicken and waffles are to die for and the mac n cheese is a wonderful blend of happiness and perfection","4331":"This is my second favorite Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas. Everything on the menu is so good that you can close your eyes and point, and you cannot go wrong. If you enjoy the traditional Thai dishes done right, then this is the place for you! The staff is fun, friendly and so attentive. I always look forward to coming back here!","5123":"Great Food! The staff is very professional and courteous.  I always get the Filet Gyro and it is amazing every single!\n\nDefinitely a place to checkout if you have a craving for Greek Food!","8720":"Below average experience for a buffet. The bouillabaisse is the best dish, good amount of seafood with a nice stew. There's some sushi but doesn't look very appetizing. Tri-tip steak is tough and my jaw got tired chewing. Bread was stale, and for a French themed hotel that's a huge no-no. I went around 2pm and most of the food looked like it had been sitting around for a while. Was curious before but now disappointed. Value isn't there for being 25$ a person.","505":"Great place, food is just wow! Staff is extremely friendly. Go for Garganelli with pistachios.","5144":"The food is pretty good. The price is also quite cheap. Very good quality to prive ratio.","1435":"Dr Melmed has a great skill set and instinct with kids. Perceptive and excellent feedback to help. Front office efficient and kind. Appointments are very hard to get but if you get the right fit for your kid it's a worthwhile wait.","2464":"This was an amazing meal all around.  It also brought us to one of our firsts in dining experiences.  This was the first time we had to bring home an appetizer!  We ordered the charcuterie platter for the 2 of us.  That platter is really meant for at least 4!  It was fantastic, however next time we would stick to the duck rillettes, duck terrine and fois gras terrine as they were our favorites.  Thats not to say that the others werent great as well including the pork cretons.  They also brought housemade pickled pickles, yummy.  We also had the cold tomato soup which was so simple yet really well executed with delicious tomatoes.  The french baguette was also great, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  For dinner we had the steak frites and tuna tartare (special).  Both were delicious, we could not get enough of the tartare!  We were beyond stuffed at the end of this meal and had some charcuterie for the next day!","8954":"I USED to enjoy going to Tao. The bouncers are great, the music is alright, the atmosphere is beautiful HOWEVER the bartenders need to get their attitudes checked!  Unfortunately, it was not one particular bartender but several at various bars throughout the club.  On one night it was a male bartender who ignored my girls and I.  He opted to suck face with a girl who came to visit him, and when we asked for a drink, he gave us a dirty look instead.  On another occasion a female bartender on the main bar near the main dance floor gave my boyfriend and I attitude because we asked POLITELY for our drinks to be re-made.  Uh, maybe she wouldn't have had to do that if she listened to the complete order. She asked what we wanted to drink then was walking away 1\/2 way through our drink order...no wonder she kept getting them wrong!  With my boyfriend and I in the industry, we understand things can get hectic and did not jump the gun & remained calm- maybe she's having a bad night?  Please explain why she walks up to us, slams the drinks on the counter and asks the gentleman standing next to us if he knows my boyfriend and to tell him that she thought he was a F'n jerk.  ahahahahaha!  What a Bit@h right?  We still tipped her, but never returned to Tao again.  We will NEVER recommend Tao to anyone who sits at our bar and inquires about clubs in Las Vegas.","3038":"The best in the Valley in my opinion. Suffering from alopecia areata they were extremely careful to cut my hair appropriately. The staff is excellent front to back. One might say they are a bit pricey, but the quality is worth the price. \n\nRecently my wife's regular stylist cancelled an appointment and Salon Estique went out of their way to accommodate her and got her in quickly with a cut and color that was exactly what she wanted. That kind of service is very hard to find these days.","2718":"Awesome meals...wonderfully entertaining!  Best Italian food in Nevada!  Kelly Clinton Holmes is an Awesome Emcee\/Hostess.  Love the local talent, the family feel of the place and the service, too!","5559":"Awesome place... beautiful rooms... the pool area seemed awesome but we were there for only 3 days and there was so much to see... the service was great and the stay was great, I got the player club card and was comped a free breakfast buffet, the day we left, so I have to go back beore it expires... haha!\n\nI love it and I want to go back!","4783":"I needed to get tid of several boxes of documents before my move and these guys came through for me. They were very professional and extremely nice. Came to my home on time and it was done very fast. I highly recommend Assured if you need a shred service this is a great choice.","8116":"Ideal was excellent came right at appointment time were fast friendly and told me what they were doing when. The price was amazing. I'd use them again for sure. Definitely recommend them.","6153":"I have only had 2 Brazilian waxes in my life, and the 2nd one was just done by Deyna. I had a horrible experience during my first wax in Canada, so seeing Deyna was delightful! She made me feel 100% comfortable, and she was very chatty and kind. She uses bed sheets as waxing strips and they work so well! She even showed me the roots of my hairs on the strip and educated me about how waxing works. I would recommend her to anyone! I'll be back to see her when I'm back in Mesa later in the year. Ask her where the F spot is. ;)","1811":"This place is really in the middle of nowhere and it's too bad because I'm sure they will be out of business soon. I probably eat there at least once a week and I have yet to have a bad meal. The chipotle steak sandwich is my favorite and the people there are as friendly as they get. Hurry up and help save this place.","4448":"I literally think this is a fake company. \n\nI got a phone stolen and submitted a claim, got the claim processed and notarized same day. The initial respondent, rick lewis replied within seconds of an email. Was shocked by how quick the response time was. \n\nI asked if I could go ahead and buy a replacement, he said it was fine to do so. From there I bought a new phone and then sent the receipt same night. Got a response that monday for a clearer image of the receipt. This was in February of 2017.... After a few weeks from not hearing, I followed up. No response. Followed up again a few weeks later. Same response. I literally followed up weekly until March, when I recevied a response that they were sorry it slipped through the cracks and then Nothing again. There call in number goes straight to voicemail and have emailed each contact info available. There is not a way to get any human on the phone. \n\nAt this point, I want to take to a local news chanel and report as a fake business or take to my rental insurance company to help dispute. I literally don't know what to do. \n\nDO NOT USE!!!!","5140":"Came here with my kid, got a large pizza and wings, staff was friendly and food was great, will definitely be back for great food and even better service!","4378":"Stylists who listen and then have the skills to cut your hair the way you want. Sandy is the best. Short hair specialist, but she can do anything! The space is casual and everyone was friendly. Give them a try, all you have to loose is the frustrations that you get at the fancy Salons, I don't need a glass of lemon water and a hour wait. Fantastic Sam's give me a talented stylist without the drama. Prices that are affordable let you give a big tip! You will walk away with a terrific haircut, change in your pocket and an appointment for your next cut. Did I mention that you can make an appointment, how smart is that.","749":"This place is on the top list of places that we went to for dinner.  This place is outstanding!  It is so hard to explain in words, but it is a must try!  The menu is setup up as serving tapas, so keep that in mind as you pick items off the menu.  Being setup as tapas, it can add up in a hurry, so this place can become quite pricey by wanting to try too many items. \n\n For starters, we had the Reuben and the Simple Tomato Salad.  The Reuben was really small and you only had like 3 small bites to it, but it did taste great.  Don't just get that for a starter, because it makes horsderves look huge.   The tomato salad was very good.  It had at least 6 different types of tomatoes in a Balsamic vinegar glaze.  \n\nThen we got the Classic Tartares as an appetizer.  This was actually made for you at your table.  I personally never had Tartares before, but I must admit it was worth trying.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the Chateaubriand, Tenderloin with Robuchon mashed potatoes that were truly buttery heaven.  I highly recommend both f these items for dinner.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would.  You must put this place on your bucket list while visiting Vegas. You will not be disappointed.   It is a all-around great place to try for any occasion.","2409":"Best mexican food ever been coming here since I was a kid it's a must try if you are in the area","345":"I visited the red line Grill half a dozen times and the service has always been excellent the food outstanding and the overall atmosphere excellent","3938":"Parfait !! Tout est parfait !! Les cocktails sont fantastiques , les serveurs sont super gentils, marrant et vraiment helpful!! C'est un r\u00e9el plaisir d'\u00eatre ici !! \nJe le conseille vivement!!","580":"Great service, low prices compared to other places nearby.  anything requiring more than a stamp on a regular envelope I take to Safe Ship. Actually, I usually drop my stamped mail there as well since they are a US Postal Service\u0099 Approved Shipper.","4361":"Horrible Experience! Horrible customer service. \nPlease do not go to this store location. Awful service specially Stephanie Cornejo as she states she is the store manager. She does not know how to treat or respect a customer. She has such a bad attitude very disrespectful. Very disappointed. I will never shop there again.","2784":"I love this store.  I haven't done any price comparison shopping so I can't really comment on the other posters' experiences, but that's because what's great about Kol Kid is they have unique things I can't find anywhere else. If you need basics it's probably not the best place, but if you want to treat yourself or someone you love you can't go wrong.  When my sister found out she was having twins that seemed like the perfect occasion to splurge on very adorable $20 onesies.  Usually I'm all about the Carter's outlet $12 six pack of onesies (which you won't find at Kol Kid).  \n\nThe staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, and in spite of the high-end nature of their stuff they are incredibly mellow about strollers and toddlers running around.  I also love that they always have new stuff coming in, so even though I browse every week or two (I live very close to the store) there's always something new to look at. \n\nIf you tend to be a frugal person or a bargain hunter, it's definitely not the place for you.  If you want to splurge once in a while (or you're lucky enough to be rich!) it's a wonderful place.","3725":"Ordered Veggie Pad Thai and was less than impressed. The sauce was a heavy tomato base that I can only liken to Campbell's Tomato Soup. Would not recommend.","1073":"I just tried this place for the first time. One word. WOW! The lighting could be a bit better but still not a bad ambien ce. The food is absolutely delicious. The prices are not bad at all considering an equivalent place in Toronto would be $15-$20 more. They were shorthanded in the kitchen today so the meal took a bit longer than it should have but it was fresh when they brought it out and tasted amazing. I had the Gamberi E Carciofi(shrimp in the sambuca sauce) for appetizer and my friend ordered the Calamari. Both were excellent but I preferred the shrimp app. Simply amazing. \n\nFor mains I ordered the Veal Boscaiola which was exactly what I was craving. A good veal in an amazing white wine cream sauce. Just perfect. My friend ordered the Lobster Jumbo Ravioli and for $5 more they threw in some shrimp and some scallops. I tried some of it and I have to say that is probably one of the best raviolis I have ever had. My friends fiance ordered the Spinach Gnocchi which was good but I personally am not too fond off gnocchi. \n\nFor desert we ordered cheesecakes. I got mine with the wild berry sauce and my friend got his with chocolate. It was smooth and creamy. It was a little weird because I think the sauce was warm and the cheesecake was cold so it was an interesting contrast. \n\nOverall absolutely amazing and I am definitely going back there to try the rest of the menu.","8704":"Friends,\n\nBEWARE! One of the saltiest, if not THE saltiest, meal I've ever had. Looks good. Smells good. Don't fall for the same trap I did.","5208":"I went with my brother in law to take his dog as she has a growth that has to be surgically removed. We had never been here as a friend said she took her dog some years ago. I have NEVER been so unhappy with a vet in all my life. This office man handled our poor dog two people holding this eight years old elderly dog. They would not let us hold her or help at all. While they were holding her down the Dr saying things like stop it i am not hurting you. This Dr was screaming orders and barking at the people working with her. Very disrespectful and rude. I would never take this dog or any animal back to this office. Run don't go. I wouldn't send my worst enemy there. It was awful","4367":"This is our fourth visit in the past 6 months.   Every time we go here, we wonder why it doesn't get 5 stars.  Full disclosure - we eat out a lot, but seldom order entrees since we like the variety that several appetizers give us.  If that's the way you like to nosh, then you have to come here - especially during happy hour.  We had 4 glasses of wine (very good pinot grigio, kick ass petite syrah) at $5 each.  Appetizers are half price during happy hour.  We splurged and shared the arugula salad - beautifully presented, nuts, fruits, cheese and just the right amount of dressing.  Then we had the soup of the day (fabulous chowder) the flatbread of the day (arugula, pepperoni, beef) and the stuffed peppers.  All under $50.  Great food, great service, welcoming environment....what more could you want on a Saturday night after a day of yardwork?","572":"I had a great experience buying an engagement ring here. The staff was very helpful and not pushy, rude or overwhelming. They had a large selection of rings and diamonds that were all top quality. The setting adjustment was done promptly and quickly available for pick up. All and all, I would recommend this Jewelery store to everyone.","881":"HORRIBLY overpriced. I wanted a rook (piercing). The guy spent SO much time trying to sell the jewelry to me. $160 for a single ear piercing and the barbell is hysterical. I was referred here by another local artist, and I dealt with the awful traffic to get there, so I paid it. At least the piercing itself was quick and clean, and four months later it's not terrible. I'll definitely never come back though, and I won't recommend it. There are amazing tattoo artists and piercers in town for half the price. Why pay for their image?","5526":"Good stuff, try the Jewish sliders:). Be ready for a long wait at lunch time.","7209":"Trying to get a replacement part for the mail filter unit and it has been 4 weeks.  They do not return calls.  I have given up.","5160":"Every time I order chicken and mushroom pizza to pick up the crust is soggy and wet! The pepperoni, however is crisp throughout the entire bottom of the pizza. Very disappointing to get home with soggy, inedible high priced pizza. FAIL","965":"I'm not really a fan of BMV.  The staff are not helpful AT ALL and I find it peculiar that they have all these books that are supposedly used but in fact look brand new.   Remember the guy who had all the bikes for super dirt cheap and they turned out to be stolen goods?  I'm just saying that when something is too good to be true, someone is paying for it.  Also, they only take cash which is inconvenient.","2556":"Amazing food. Super fast service. I tried the quesadilla which came with guacamole on the side. I loved it. I'm going to go back and try more of their food.","234":"The customer service at this Trade Secrets location is brutal. Staff are extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming. One woman is ALWAYS on the phone and her phone calls don't sound like they're work related. No one ever asks if you need help or even acknowledges your existence. I've visited for threading a few times and will never be going back. I'm not sure they're properly trained because they seem to just rip the hair without actually pulling it out from the root. I've also left with broken skin more than once which has never happened to me elsewhere and I've been threading for a long time. As if this wasn't all bad enough they always try to up-sell you when you're having a service done. I don't want to be asked five times if I want a massage or told that my eyebrows could really use improvement. That's definitely NOT the way to keep a customer.","2185":"Super slow service. Not busy but we waited like 20 minutes to get our order taken. Don't order the chicken lettuce wraps. Don't know what it was, but it couldn't be chicken. When our rolls came we had to ask for wasabi and ginger.  They brought three out of our six drinks. We had to ask for the complete order. Unfriendly.","4057":"This place came in clutch on New Years Eve last minute, without a reservation. I have to say I'm shocked this place didn't come more highly recommended! The food was really special, with such a wide array of flavors and perfect portion size. Our waiter was very friendly, very helpful with our questions about the menu. Also, the decor in the place makes you feel like you're in a museum or watching the history channel - it is so well designed! I recommend this place and will come back!","587":"Jeannie is an awesome aesthetician!  Her facials are wonderful and she uses organic products on your skin.  She not only pampers your face but your upper body as well. During the time that masques are working their wonder on your face, she massages your neck, back, shoulders and arms.\nYour face will truly thank you and you'll look forward to your next visit.","2010":"Always get fast and friendly service and food is always good. My go to for delivery or a late meal","1797":"Quick , fast,  and affordable... quiet environment  and friendly staff.  what I like is the ambience and the food... not authentic but still really tasty!!","5956":"Dr. Jacobsen and her staff go above and beyond to make their patients feel comfortable for any of their oral health care needs. Not only do they care about their existing patients, they also reach out to the community dedicating their time to help those in need. I am thankful to have found my dental home!","679":"This place sucks! The owner is super rude and is very pushy trying to get you to buy other services. She rushes your service to get to other people and does what she wants to your nails not what you want.  They reuse there stuff for your pedicure thats nasty. I will not come back there are to many nail salons in this area to go back here. Lady's don't waste your money on this place they don't care about you just your money and it shows in the service and the attitudes here! And she messed my eyebrows up will have to wait forever for them to grow back just rushes threw everything.","7315":"Went here for New Years. Our waiters name was Dave.  He took our drink orders and orders from the prefixed menu.  Once we received our drinks, that was about all we saw of Dave.  Our starters came out and was served from the help staff.  Our waiter kept walking by without checking in on us.  We were all finished starters and then our mains came out.  The helpers cleared our dishes and served the mains.  Still no check in with the waiter.  My beer glass and water glass were empty and Dave keeps walking on by checking in on other tables and seemed to be avoiding us.  This was the he first and last time going to this place.  Way better options for that price point\n\nIf you absolutely love butter on everything give it a try.","5611":"Good food and good energy in this place. Crowded during peak times, plan to wait and you will not regret it.","8908":"I've purchased wood here for years, and recommended this business to friends.  But today, I pulled up to purchase a couple bags of wood, and the employee who was supposed to be selling me the wood took a look at my Obama 2012 bumber sticker, took a few steps back, and then said sarcastically well, i GUESS I will still help you, even though you voted for Obama.   Not only was this rude, but none of your business.  You are in the business of selling wood, and I guess also you are in the business of trying to insult your customers.  Sour grapes cause your candidate lost the election? Keep that to yourself, Sir, and just load the wood in my car.  Rude.  Poor customer service. Inappropriate.","5340":"I have a 65lb rambunctious lab\/border collie mix and we LOVE Petsburgh.  I tried taking him to the chain groomers and they'd only trim nails on one or two paws before giving up and they'd still charge the whole price. Petsburgh knows how to properly handle the animals and has no trouble grooming my dog. His fur is always beautifully cut, nails nicely trimmed and he comes home looking and smelling clean and fresh. Prices are reasonable too. I highly recommend Petsburgh!","4870":"Very good tacos and great price , they have very good salsas happy hr 3-6 every day beer\nOnly 2.25 and 2 tacos for $3","132":"Geez. There seems to be some negative buzz surrounding this place. Most of the stuff I read made it seem like there wasn't any shot of much good coming out of it. So, imagine my surprise when the food was good, the service was attentive, and the overall experience was one that I'd come back for.\n\nIn all fairness, a lot of that negative stuff I read was about their Theatre district location on King West, which I've neer been to, but that just doesn't hold much value for me. The fact is, most of those places on that strip of King seem to get a bad rap. Get 'em in, get 'em fed, get 'em out; that's their philosophy as they wait for theatre goers to arrive, and then again when they hope for them to come back after the show... thankfully, Hey Lucy's Annex location isn't anything like that.\n\nWith their soft lighting, chandeliers and black-and-white cow print seats, it's difficult to describe what exactly they were going for when they designed this place, but somehow, it works well and provides a nice backdrop, particularly for a date night. The ambience is hip, the decor is comfortable and cozy, and the space is of a decent enough size that it can easily accommodate both large groups and couples.\n\nHey Lucy is busy in the summer evenings, mostly because of their killer patio that lines the entire side of the building. Perfect for people-watching, this packed space is a nice addition to The Annex, and it holds up well against other patios on the street (except for Pauper's Pub!).\n\nProbably what Hey Lucy is most well-known for is their martinis. They've got a pretty decent martini menu with some interesting things on it, like the Godzilla and the Freedom 55, but man, these guys are expensive. Although they do come with a minimum of 2 ounces of booze, you can expect to shell out 9 bucks plus taxes for one. And while that may seem ok at first, having a few of them can easily add up... trust me on that. If martinis are your thing, but getting ripped off for them isn't, then you're definitely going to want to come back on a Wednesday. Wednesday is Martini Wednesday at Hey Lucy, and the prices drop to 4 bucks for the exact same martinis. But come early, other people like a good deal when they see one too, and this place fills up pretty quickly.\n\nTheir menu doesn't follow any sort of style; it's a bit all over the place, but it's still the sorta thing you might expect from a place like this. Pastas, wood-fired pizzas, paninis, sandwiches, all of it is pretty good, but unfortunately, this can unexpectedly change once the place fills up. In Hey Lucy's case, it's better to go when it isn't that busy.\n\nWhile I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Hey Lucy, if you're in the area and looking for a night out, Hey Lucy provides nicely.","1642":"My ac started leaking Wednesday, I called a company and they came to my house and quoted me $7000 for an entirely new system even those he didn't go into my attic he said that needed replacing anyways. So I got Stephens number from a friend and called him Thursday morning. He was at my house after I got off work at 5:30 and was able to tell me that I only needed half a unit and gave me a very affordable price. His guys (Matt & Brian) came that very next day and had the new unit installed in less than 2 hours! They were very respectful and I will be using this company for anything else I need. Thanks again guys, you really saved us from the 115 degrees next week.","6251":"Dr Ptak is excellent at what he does. He understood everything I was talking abt and gave me the confidence that I wanted with the work he has done. Very skilled and intelligent definitely would give his name to others for future references.","7078":"This is probably my favourite neighbourhood pub. \n\nSure it's a quiet spot, not the kind of place to see and be seen, but an honest place. Lots of east coasters amongst their regulars - they always make sure you feel welcome. Service is friendly and efficient.\n\nThat's where I go whenever I'm in the mood for good and reasonably well priced food. Drinks are cheap too, and beer is always cold. I usually order the 'extreme nachos', and they sure are pretty extreme - I would never be able to eat all that food by myself. Make sure you have company to share it.","5118":"I've had breakfast here many times through the years and the muffins are really good. The breakfast menu is a slight step up from the average breakfast joint. Minus one star because a few times I've come in for breakfast late and the muffin i was served tasted microwaved.","1259":"Had two packages to send out.  One USPS and the other a FedEx.  As I was carrying my USPS box I saw that they also handle FedEx.  So with one stop it was easy.  The More I'd also a great spot with Professional Sport team keys for your house, phone calling cards, and a good selection of greeting cards.  If you need to send out something quick they will be great for you.","7465":"Cold in Vegas right now and pho hits the spot. \n\nThey were a little short staffed I think, there were pleanty of empty tables that weren't bussed yet and I was the only person waiting and there was still a 5 min wait. Nonetheless it hit the spot","8463":"Thinly sliced and seasoned bologna and salami between a perfectly toasted roll with a hint of mustard and melted America. cheese. The Special is one of best sandwiches in Montreal. \n\nWe were served by the current owner Sharon, who clearly has a love of the establishment and chatted with us about its history. Wilensky's is everything you want in no frills dining.","8405":"My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place. The food and service are both always superb!! A must try. We've only had one negative experience- the female server at the back of the restaurant has an attitude problem.","2501":"Horrible, would NEVER rent from them again. ... in dominican republic,  no one showed up to provide our reserved car.   Finally,  we got someone,  he spoke no English,  no badge,  no car markings,  and a BIG scar across his cheek and neck.  He wanted to take us somewhere? ?  Are you crazy?

Food and staff are great.  Have been here once for dinner and once for lunch buffet. Both were delicious. Buffet had a nice variety.","2619":"Two stars b\/c Sara our server was uber-professional and spot-on. It started off with the dual hostesses pointing our 6 top group to a booth in front of the door on a freezing night but the table across the aisle had 6-8 coats hanging on the hooks for our booth and we couldn't get in. We asked for another table and were treated like idiots for even asking such a stupid question. After openly scoffing and scowling at us we got another table. Right next to a group of a dozen 7-8 year olds who had no adult supervision and ran around screaming and throwing shit around the room. We actually pulled our tables back from them to give them more running room. After all this crap the food came out and was  - meh.....\nOur server was great to us and embarrassed for the restaurant itself...\nStay away from this place...there a ton of better places in the Waterfront","5173":"I was sorely disappointed with the performance. After watching them on ABDC for so long, I expected a lot more. So many of their skits and moves are just rehashes of what everyone did back in the 90s. I suppose the show was tailored towards an audience that had absolutely no previous knowledge of breaking \/ popping etc. Like other people said, it got repetitive and boring. There was NO originality. IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD. I'm asking for my money back. I was not pleased at all. I really wanted to like the performance. I'm giving the rating other people talked about, but were too scared to give. Some people call it bashing, others call it hating...I call it keeping it real...","2485":"Pool service sucked.  Pool technician (???) spent 15-20 min once a week.  The filters had not been cleaned in a year, pool was dirty after 15-20 Min job.  Last time he serviced (???) the pool, there was dirt in the bottom of the pool.  I can't remember the last time it was vacuumed.  You wouldn't want to swim after it was cleaned (???).  Took water sample for analysis and the pool water is dead.  I have to drain and refill the pool.  I spent 2 hours cleaning the filters.","426":"From the slot machines upon arrival at the airport to the larger than life variety buffets, everything is just over the top. I guess everyone has to visit at least once in their lifetime and you'll be amazed or totally disgusted? :)\n\nThe hotel setup that mimics everything, you can have a little piece of Italy, France, New York, Egypt, pirates, classy to ghetto fabulous, you name it, you can and will have it. Btw, Elvis, Marilyn, everyone is in Vegas! \n\nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas + Ka-ching $$$$ !","1998":"Service was great, outdoor patio ist pretty nice. We had filet mignon which was great and worth 4 stars. Unfortunately my vegetable farcis was not good at all (overcooked, far too many onions and almost no quinoa) and really too expensive ($20) for the poor quality. I would really give 0 stars for the vegetable farcis.","4556":"My wife and I just ate here for lunch based on a recommendation from a local. This is one of the worst buffets I've tried in Vegas. The food was less than mediocre, and in most cases barely edible. Breads were stale and dry, flavors of most things seemed bland and cheap, and a platter of fresh burgers just put out were already cold. Avoid this buffet and spend your money elsewhere!","2195":"Worst experience ever in renting a car.  Booked thru the national center- car was not there when I had reserved it for. Lost a whole day of travel because the car was not available anywhere in the area.  Got sent to several other offices in the city where I could get the vehicle I needed- but, on no- not there either.  HORRIBLE customer service.  I will use another line next time.","2677":"Food is pretty good, and a nice atmosphere; but the service is consistently horrible","715":"Pizza was good, but i was annoyed that the delivery guy made me go down to hotel lobby to get the pizza.  There are no restrictions at the hotel forcing this.  Will choose a different place for delivery in the future.  Delivery means come to you, not meet me half way.","3057":"this is possibly the worst restaurant I have ever been in. should have been clued in when at lunch time no other patrons were in there. we had 8 people and 3 of them ordered the chicken Ceasar salads. the salad had a horrible fish smell and tasted even worst. they put hard dry piece of chicken on top of lettuce that was soaked in fish sauce. we've all had many Ceasars salads in our life made with anchovies and I'm sorry it does not end up tasting like dead fish. the owner was rude and had attitude when we said none of the 3 could eat the salads. there was no one in the restaurant and 5 employees walking around but no one could bother checking on our table for drinks or even offer us a dessert menu. the owner didn't take any of the salads off the bill never told us the bill included a inflated tip and as we counted our money to pay the tab he had the nerve to say you can leave more!! in the 5 years I've been on this site this is only the 2nd place I've ever left a negative review, ever. that should tell you how bad it was.","5203":"My Friend brought this place to my attention for what a rip off it is! Not price wise, but on the concept and look of the place...It's a direct knock-off of a salon in Vancouver. Now what was the name of that place in Van?...Hmmm....I think it is called...you guessed it! The Chop Shop! In fact they had their own TV show! \n\nC'mon man, it's okay to be inspired by something or get an idea, but taking the look, the concept and the name! Well, that's just plain lazy! and pretty sh*ty to boot! who ever owns this place should feel ashamed.\n\nWell I imagine there is a lawyer somewhere in Van licking his Chops (pun intended) and putting his legal briefs on!\n\nWhen ever did the world become so uninspired? and there my friend was telling me Montreal was a unique place full of artists and creative types.\n\nOne star for being lazy!","8796":"Finding this coffee shop a few blocks from my new apartment last year was an absolute game changer. Reminiscent of some of my old haunts in San Francisco, like Blue Bottle and Ritual - if you've never experienced good coffee, you owe it to yourself. \n\nFurthermore, the atmosphere and service is exceptional. Go now, you will love it.","5514":"If you know me, you know I love me some yoga! If you're my friend on yelp, you're prob thinking: stop writing reviews about yoga studios and go to a restaurant!  Well I can't help it! The yoga scene in Pittsburgh is really amazing! And The Shala is a great addition!\n\nAs I say with all my yoga reviews, yoga is very personal and a unique experience for each person! So, you really have to try out the studio for yourself and decide what type of yoga you want to practice. The Shala is the only Ashtanga studio in the Pittsburgh and they have a range of classes for every level.  So don't be scared to check this studio out, even If you're new to yoga!  \n\nAnd if you're already familiar with Ashtanga yoga, this is definitely the studio for you! Laura is very knowledgable, loves Ashtanga, and really great at helping you deepen your practice!! The traditional Mysore style of teaching is also offered several days a week.\n\nAs far as the non-yoga aspects of this studio.  The space is lovely and can hold about 20ish students at max capacity.  Most of the classes are smaller though, so you that you can receive adequate attention and instruction.  Props and mats are available.  There is a changing area and bathroom, that's very clean and tidy.  Plenty of street parking (metered and not).  Very easy to find and located right on Butler in Lawrenceville.  \n\nIn terms of schedule and costs.  The packages and classes are very reasonable!! There are also new member specials and student pricing.  The schedule is a little sparse, since the studio is newer, but they offer the standard morning and evening class times with a few weekend classes.","8333":"Excellent in every way.  Attentive and fun owners who tend bar every weekend night - GREAT live music, excellent wine selection.   Keeping Fountain Hills young.... one weekend at a time.","3700":"I admit... The food was pretty good.  However, the service was terrible.  We were 5 min late for our reservation and they made us wait 1 hour at the bar (seated after 9:30)  The hostess was incredibly rude and it took almost 30 min to get service at the bar.  When we were finally seated the service only got worse.  They didn't refill our waters or wine glasses once.  They served our first course to another table and never once explained what was laid in front of us.  They knew how terrible the service was (we have said nothing at this point) so they offered us free dessert.  But... The kicker was the $50 bottle if wine that ended up as $100 on the bill.  We were amazed so we asked the table next to us how their meal was.  Turns out they were getting a free meal due to the 5 reservation changes made by the restaurant.  Hope this place gets their act together.  Currently it's an embarassment to a hotel that's trying to be upscale.  Hype not quality.","1350":"I had the zucchini squash, chicken, shrimp, and the mushroom skewers. Made it a combo to add rice. Maybe it was the soggy, tepid vegetables or the bland rice, but I will never be eating from this food truck again.","2361":"I ordered a meal online for delivery and the food didn't arrive until 2 hours later (I live 4 minutes down the road). When the food Did come, it was cold. The only good thing was the energy beet juice I ordered. Pretty good stuff.","2181":"Great place.  you have got to try the Carne Asada Nacho.  So wonderful.  Their Salsa is fantastic.","2491":"Janelle was such a sweetheart! She made me feel at ease like I was talking to a friend. She took time out first to explain everything and also took interest in my brows and how exciting it will be to see them grow in. She also offered brow tinting which I absolutely love! I'm glad I had to reschedule my first appointment so that I ended up having her as my waxer because she takes pride in her work and made sure I was loving my brows as well! I will definitely continue to book my appointments with her! \n:)","4650":"I had a great experience with Americas Choice Realty. Mia D'Alexis was my realtor. She did an amazing job helping me find the house I was looking for. She was prompt to reply to all my emails and phone calls. Also negotiated a good deal for me. Highly recommend!","2517":"You can tell the people who work here are serious about their coffee, but they're not at all snobby or stuck-up about it. In fact, every time I come in here I'm amazed at how friendly the baristas are. One recent time I leaving here at closing time, the barista asked if I wanted a cup of coffee for the road, explaining that he had some left over that would just be thrown away otherwise. It's things like that that make the difference between a four-star place and a five-star one.\n\nEven without the incredibly friendly staff, though, Espresso a Mano is excellent. A few things I love about it:\n1. Delicious, delicious espresso drinks. The latte is spot-on, and I'm sure it's just as good iced.\n2. Reasonable prices--not the cheapest I've seen in Pittsburgh, but by no means expensive.\n3. $1.90 to stay coffee with one free refill. I didn't love the coffee as much as the latte, but it's still damn tasty.\n4. Great cold-brewed coffee that's very strong, but not unpleasantly acidic.\n\nThe space is also nice, the wifi is free, and the location is fun. It's a little bit tricky to get to from where I live, but the trip is more than worth it.","1165":"Great bistro-style restaurant & bakery. The service was decent, pretty fast and I like that you were able to get your drinks right away and find a seat while they make your food. For dine-in, there are soups, sandwiches, paninis, pizza and pastas, and you can get combos with most of those too with fruit or crisps. They also make specialty coffees, and there are free refills on regular coffee and soft drinks, which was nice.\n\nYou can also buy anything to go and they make fresh breads and pastries.","2236":"Dave Smith was highly effective in the courtroom. He was overly prepared, quick on his toes, and very intelligent. He researched all the facts and targeted the charges from multiple angles. I would highly recommend him and his staff. They are top notch.","3746":"Amazing food!!  \nI give a full 5 stars to the staff, management, and chefs. Great environment placed at the center of Old Town Scottsdale. If you haven't been here before. I'd say it's a perfect mix of upper class light sports bar and stylish sit down restaurant. Well put together dishes by the chefs. I'd recommend my favorites of the onion ring tower and the BBQ bacon burger or one of their various street tacos. I'm not a drinker past some Ice T but if you have a favorite beer. I'd challenge you to try out the Yard House and see if yours is one of the 125 beers on tap!","2821":"Went for dinner for 2 on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly satisfied.  The wine list is fairly large, with nice selections of wine by the glass if your partner would rather beer.  I have a hard time going anywhere and not ordering a cheese plate if offered (it must be my time living in Wisco) so, we started with the cheese and antipasto plate.  It was really good, with yummy meats and cheeses, accompanied with fig sauce and relished onions.  But the best part was the bread.   All together yummy and would make for a great stop after work downtown.\n\nFor dinner, I had the linguini in red clam sauce and my friend had the stuffed banana peppers.  As others have commented on, the portion size was smaller than typically expected, but frankly it was the right amount for anyone of a normal size (ie less than 250lbs) to get your fill.  The stuffed banana peppers were quite spicy, in a really good way, and the linguini was good, maybe not spectacular, but a staple.    \n\nWe did go on a Tuesday night fairly late (~8p), so I wasn't surprised there were only a couple of other tables there.  However, it did make for excellent service.  Our waitress was attentive and nice.","3468":"Staff is very friendly and fast whenever I go here. Lots of selection in different types of ramen.","7344":"We really like staying at the Encore.  It is so elegantly decorated - vibrant and serene at the same time.  You do not have to walk miles to get to your room or from one end of the casino to the other.  Parking is very convenient.  The location on the strip is great - across from the mall and near other nice casino properties.  It is only a short indoor stroll to the Wynn to have a larger casino and more restaurant selections.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed (although showing just a little wear and tear) and we never have heard noise from the hallways or from other guests.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  We loved the buffet - probably the best we have been to in Las Vegas.  \n\nThe only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if you just want coffee, juice, yogurt, or a muffin in the morning the prices are high - the ventilation in the casino isn't great -  the casino seems to have tightened up on slot machine payouts - and if your room is on the Strip side you may feel or hear vibrations from the nightclub (we did one night - on the 25th floor - but we were warned about it when we checked in and chose that side of the building anyway.)  \n\nOverall, we definitely recommend the Encore for an above-average experience.","6463":"Third time here in one year and we are from San Francisco!  This place is always prompt and courteous and helpful.  Did I mention the food is fantastic?!","4775":"Usually, I've enjoyed this location but I've had 3 consecutive trips that were horrible. When the employee making the smoothie is looking around and unsure of the ingredients then know it's over. I'm not sure if they are new hires or simply don't know how to make simple smoothies. Today, a young guy was making my smoothie and clearly was clueless and the girl behind the register knew it and didn't bother to help or make sure he was putting proper ingredients in the blender. Instead , she checked me out fast as possible and said I'm out later. Leaving me w clueless guy making my smoothie. He continued to blend and add water for another 2 minutes until he handed me a slushy w zero flavor. Avoid","2543":"Loved the food! Atmosphere funky and artsy. Staff good. Creative entrees prepared with care. I am giving it 5 stars even though the bathroom was outdated and not the freshest. Great place for people who like a funky vibe. Probably not for the uber conservative.","5716":"My family and I came here and was greeted very professionally, and seated with a Hispanic male server. Before I knew it he had passed us off to a a white woman server. So the service was quite non chalant. Tina the server treated us okay. She was more of an order taker and did not seem to care about our experience. She never asked if we wanted any appetizers or any bar drinks. That is okay the food was okay but the thing that got me was she was throwing the n-word around like dollar bills at a strip club. I only mention this because me and my family are African-American. Guess we'll never go here again!!!!","2958":"Truly a wonderful morning experience. Wandering in with still sleep in your eyes and memories of your bed you're greeted by a warm and inviting staff that are eager to please. \n\nThe menu is full of variety offering traditional and expected breakfast items with many featuring fresh fruit and various options. The staff is very attentive and quick to see how you're doing and to refill that mug of coffee. \n\nGreat food, terrific atmosphere and a great way to start a weekend of exploring the city or just heading back home and living on the couch and exploring all of those ignored books.","5136":"If I could give it 0 stars I would.   Absolute worst service we have ever experienced.  Didn't receive all of our food ordered, asked 5 times and still didn't receive it and then she brought us our check still without receiving all our food.  No apologies just a nasty look on the girls faces.  We paid exact change and left.  Apparently made enough in tips from other people to get their boobs done but we definitely won't be back.  Sad because it was always our favorite every time we come here. Monte carlo needs to take charge","6523":"The service was ok, but the food was not what I was expecting, I always get the same thing every time I go to any jackasstors. I thought I would try this one since It was on the way but the bow tie pasta which I always get was not enjoyable what so ever. It just did not taste the way I usually always get it . As well the atmosphere was not something I enjoyed, I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere maybe to shops at don mills or downtown.","4258":"I also found a great car online and was very interested. I did send an e-mail to Stateline and got a reply right away! I went over to the dealership the next day. I only looked at the car to make sure it would work for my life style and decided to return the next day to drive the car with my husband. \n\nWe decided to buy the car and ended up trading in our old car got EVEN BETTER financing then the loan I already had and got the keys to the new car all in the evening.  Everyone was really helpful and nice!\n\nI have to say thank you to my sale rep, Sandra, for really helping us get the car to the price we wanted and also to trade in our used car. Also the finance person, Aaron, who really helped us get an outstanding rate. Top notch finance professional. We were impressed and felt really good about our used car buying from Stateline. We would go back and recommend these two people.","5491":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!! Everything is great from Kristen upfront, all the coaches to the way the whole gym is set up! So glad I found them I'm mentally and physically stronger, I don't know where I'd be without them!","5957":"I have been buying fudge here for years. It is the best I've found!  I especially like the maple walnut and chocolate cheesecake!","6385":"AMAZING!!! If you like an intimate place with amazing cuisine , Sel is the place! \nMy husband and I have decided to come here for a date night once a month. \nThe food s absolutely the best !!","7230":"Absolutely delicious!! Get the avocado green curry, so yummy!  We will be back for sure, probably weekly. Highly recommended!","3045":"Amazing. A fantastic chicken parm sandwich - well cooked, great sauce, soft bun. Great recommendations by the owner. I'll be back.","275":"I have been to this place on a Sunday morning somewhere around 9. Most of the tables were occupied already. We were lucky to get one by the window. The food tasted really good. There hash and french toast are worth going for.","7144":"Floyd's is great. I'm not gonna beat around the bush on this one. It's better than great. It is stupendous. The atmosphere is lively, clean and modern while still creating a feeling of nostalgia. I don't know if it's the pictures of musical legends on the wall or the 'ol fashion barber shop vibe but what I do know is its inviting. More important than the atmosphere. The staff. Each barber\/stylist (shoutout to Syndney) has their own unique vibrancy they present while also maintaining a level of skill and professionalism that's unparalleled. If your trying to get a great cut and exceptional service, than do yourself a favor and treat your self to Floyds 99. It's worth every penny.","526":"Went here for lunch today. I had the bbq pulled pork with a side salad. The bbq was great and didn't feel too heavy. Almost felt healthy! The salad was nice and fresh. Atmosphere was great. The thing I liked the most was the complimentary sparkling water. I never see that. There were a lot of good options on the menu that I hope to try sometime soon.","7459":"O.K, so heres the thing. These guys got their one of the hottest ramen noodle joints in the country yada yada nod, before they were even open. Can you say great marketing team? Absolutely, and the place is really nice looking, but it's NOT good. And this is not an authentic vs not authentic thing as many people have taken one side or the other for. I could care less if it was authentic, as long as it tasted good, which it does not. Flavorless, greasy, over cooked this, under cooked that. The miso broth pork bowl was the biggest travesty of them all. There were 4 of us, and there were so many holes in the execution of the dishes, that it just felt clumsy and...yes, had you wishing for a more seasoned team (which may be why many people are screaming for authenticity by authentic they may just be saying they want something thats good....or at the very least something worth the price tag...which in this case is a little exorbitant compared to their competition.  Base price of most dishes is already on the border, and then come the add ons. Add Ons which are not add ons in other places that serve ramen. Bad form, they essentially even charge you extra for flavor. Bottom line, authentic, not authentic....I would rather spend my money in a place where the dishes come WITH the flavor included in the price. If you can make it down to Ahwatukee, Sushi Ken's got some stellar ramen. Ramen Republic not too shabby either, I would skip this one though. There are so many places where you'll be paying for a lot less than an awesome marketing team tells you you should pay for this kind of thing, and get a whole lot more.","1060":"Do not go to this location. Against my better judgement I ignored the prior bad reviews hoping I would have a better experience (since this location is the closest one to me). Nope. Got home to find my 8 piece half extra crispy\/half grilled dark meat only was half grilled\/half original with both white and dark meat.","6323":"I discovered Fresh Start Aesthetics through a Groupon for Microneedling. I've had two Microneedling, my eyebrows waxed and one Hydrafacial so far. From the phone call to schedule my appointment to the minute I leave I feel taken care of. Candace is absolutely amazing at what she does. I don't trust many with my eyebrows, now I won't let anyone else touch them. She's a perfectionist with waxing in the very best way possible. Knowledgeable, friendly and never pushy with products or services. The office is absolutely stunning and very clean! My skin is looking and feeling smoother than ever. I highly recommend Candace and this location as I am extremely happy with the all around experience!","685":"Food is amazing. I'm outside the delivery area, but it is worth the drive. They make the egg foo young wonderful (where they put everything on top and not inside) The Moo Shoo Pork is a family favorite, but they do run out at times (it's that good) Hot and sour sizzling rice soup and the sesame chicken are some other favorites. A definite family run business they make common human errors, but always correct it and are always friendly when face to face.","2534":"This location is relatively new. While it didn't exactly stand out from the other salons, I was happy with my experience! My friend and I got shellac, and they did both our nails completely in under 30 minutes. This was great since we were on our lunch break! The gentleman who serviced me (dirty minds, get your head outta the gutter) was friendly and made light, friendly conversation. They are VERY detail oriented and every time I look at the shellac placement neat my nail beds I'm just in awe at house quick, yet precise he was.\n\nIt was my first time doing shellac and he took me through every step, seemed very knowledgeable.  \n\nFor sure if they keep being quick and doing good work I'll go back for more shellac colourings! Can't wait to try a mani-pedi at this location.","497":"I write this review with a heavy heart. Excalibur is our home hotel in Vegas. We just got done with our 3rd stay in 3 years there. The 2 previous years we had no problems. \n\nWe checked in on a Monday. We needed a handicapped accessible room. And that's all we got. No view, granted not all the rooms get a view. There was hair in the shower, and the shower was a glass door type and there was black stuff coming off the metal parts on the floor, dust on the furniture, pamphlets on the floor from a different casino\/hotel from the previous person, the bottom handle on the dresser was broken off and put inside the dresser drawer and the kicker was we found old boxer shorts (underwear) behind the t.v stand. It just doesn't seem like they care at all about the accessible rooms. Like I said, this was our first year with problems. If we need another budget hotel the next time we stay, we will chose excalibur again but I will request tower 2. It's the updated tower. \n\nI'm sorry excal, I still love you. I'm just very disappointed in you....","6570":"They refuse to serve tap water despite my party's over $90 in orders (for 5 people).   They will only serve bottle water which we all know is environmentally unfriendly.  An $8 shake is about half the size for most shakes elsewhere.  Will never be back here.","609":"Kevin and debra are the best. I've  had the patia bowl and a lot of the Hawaiian ice flavors and iced coffee is my favorite!  I can't go enough I know  they need Sunday off but I'd go if they were open.  My favorite flavor is melon it tastes like honey dew","1902":"This preparer did around 10 years of our taxes and made mistakes all 10 years. We have received letters for the last 3 years from the IRS due to these mistakes. After he corrected two past years of them we then heard from IRS again this past year and I called him. His receptionist answered and said she would give him the message so as I was preparing to send him the IRS letter I get a letter from him stating we were asking a level of service he can't provide then dropped us as clients. Tax preparers should fix the mistakes.This preparer did not.","3161":"The Roti Canai is a dish I order every time. Really tasty and one of the best I have tasted. \nTom Yum soup, Nasi Goreng, the malaysian fried rice as well as Curry Laska are all equally good. The curry laska is an enormous dish that can easily be shared.The Singapore Rice Noodle is okay, not one of my favorite dishes here.\n\nThe service which is good, fast and efficient.","5452":"This is my least favourite Starbucks but the closest one to my previous job (ugh first world problems). I would rather drive 2 km further just to avoid this place. THAT BAD.\n\nThis place is busy and impersonal. They decline requests that other locations would grant and let's just keep in mind that this is a corporate location.\n\nIf I pay $4 each for a drink and ask for a extra cup of hot water, then I think that is a fair request. They would rather give two tall cups over the requested venti cup. They say it's a rule but I'll just have to ask for a double cup on my venti drink.\n\nI think they make it more complicated that it should be.\n\nTherefore, I would not support this location and always tell all my friends not to go.\n\nHaterade.\n-jT","50":"I came here with a frequent film.ca goer. He's a big fan of the theatre and explained it's evolution of funding and renovations. It seems to be a gem in this big city!  We went to see the new Star Wars less than a week after it came out. The ticket price was $4 cheaper than cineplex, which was awesome! \n\nWhat shocked me was that I walked into the theatre and there was only about 18 people in the auditorium. THATS IT? Not sure what this means for the theatre, but for me it worked in my benefit. The chairs were nice, but I am short. So, this leaves me with my one complaint: if the theatre was in fact busy, I'd probably have to sit on my legs or a booster seat or something!! The slant in the floor was so gradual that sitting behind someone really obstructed my view. I was able to move over and find better seating, but it would worry me in a busy showing.","890":"Having never ridden, I wanted to learn how to safely ride the scooter we bought.  TEAM AZ was able to provide a scooter for me, and the syllabus built from zero knowledge to safe riding basic skills.   The instruction given by Bill Seltzer was tops.  He was very professional and super-encouraging and it is obvious he loves teaching safe riding.","5078":"The food here is generally pretty good and the atmosphere is nice, however, many of their employees are arrogant and unprofessional. Their prices are also a bit ridiculous for what you get. \n\nOn our most recent visit, we had ordered a salad, a slice of pizza, two pastries, coffee, and a soda (all were readily available behind the counter). \n\nWe received our soda and coffee, along with a numbered card, and found a seat while we waited for the rest of our order to be brought out. \n\nWe waited 15 minutes for our fairly basic order, until I went up to the counter, numbered card in hand, and politely inquired how much longer it would be. \n\nA dismissive employee greeted me with a rude What'd you order?. \n\nWhile telling her my order again, she cut me off mid-sentence and said, We'll have it out when it's ready. Go sit down and we'll have it right out. \n\nA few minutes later, the food came out and it tasted all right, but there's no reason we should have had to wait 15+ minutes for food that was already sitting right behind the counter when we ordered it. \n\nAt a normal sit-down restaurant, 15 minutes would be acceptable, but this place should be the equivalent of a Panera with their serving times. \n\nAlso, it should be noted that on this recent visit, there was a guy who looked like the owner, walking around the restaurant. You would think the employees would be on their best behavior when he's around, but apparently not. \n\nOverall, The Stone Oven's food is decent, but their service leaves a lot to be desired.","8462":"I stumbled upon this place after arriving from a long flight and after checking into the Wynn across the street. \n\nThis place is located in an ideal location outside across from the Wynn and next to fashion show mall. Great outside view to people watch. \n\nThe food was pretty good. I ordered a hickory bbq grilled chicken sandwich with fried onions, avacado and an order of sweet potato fries to share. The sandwich was a bit messy but ooo so tasty! Service was decent, pretty quick and efficient. It's worth a visit back once I'm in the area for an extended vacay.","5588":"I seldom write reviews for businesses but I know how daunting it is to find a reliable handyman. I'd like to point out that Brian does an exemplary job. He has a very polite and knowledgeable demeanor, and delivers excellent results. I've used this company for three jobs and I will keep using them for future needs. I especially like the fact that they base their estimates on specific details that the customer provides through pictures and measurements.","7809":"I hate this place because it is not good it taste like milk not yogurt and they don't greet you","5409":"Great staff and great work, any time I need anything they get me in asap, Dr. Lee is great and I love all the staff very friendly as soon as you walk in the door","1609":"I've been coming from the northwest valley to eat at this pizza joint since I was a very young child... I'm now 26 and I still love this place. Great food and fun pin-ball machines. Everyone should try this place once.","7564":"I travel to Champaign nearly every week and will often eat here.  The food is good and the waitstaff are very helpful and friendly.","2314":"If I could I wouldn't even give one star!!!! Shitty customer service! And half ass work was done to my carpet! I specifically said for the carpet cleaner to speak with me about all the work that was being done even left my personal cellphone number, he cleaned my stairs knowing stains were not removable and charged me for something that looks exactly the same!!! Instead of telling me that it needed the deep cleaning he just did the work without consulting me now they suggest for me to pay extra on top of the $75 for them to come back and deep clean this time! Worst carpet cleaning service I've ever used !!! Never again!!! And the supervisor even had terrible customer service!","5079":"I am okay with Cherryblossom, really I am.  Nothing I ate there sucked.  I want to be clear, however, that they have no ramen.  \n\nNot their fault, mind you, that people have said that they do, and I drove over there, boyfriend in tow, Jonesing for ramen, and there was nothing on the menu but udon and soba noodles, and I was so disappointed that I couldn't order either of them, and I hated the bread, and I can't remember what I ordered becauase there was no ramen.  But never mind all of that.  My boyfriend ordered sushi even though I told him I wanted to leave.  And his food was decent, for Arizona sushi at a place that serves bread and 'clamari with anchoby tomato' (sic) as well.  Yeah, I eat food off of his plate.  You got a problem with that?\n\nThe upshot of my visit there is that I left unsure that boyfriends are worth all of this trouble, and unsure why Cherryblossom doesn't put a real bowl of ramen on the menu.","2360":"Travelled with my husband and 2 other couples and we all LOVED this place. Each couple had a junior suite and the staff accommodated our request to have our rooms next to each other.  The rooms were beautiful, clean, spacious and had everything we needed.  I loved having a kitchenette and all the utensils needed. The bathrooms were gorgeous with the decor and I loved the huge jet bath tub! \n\nThe staff was super friendly. We loved the non-smoking atmosphere.  It was close enough to the strip but nice to be a little removed from the noise and chaotic vibe of the strip. \n\nThe best part was the pool area. It's very nice and a resort-like setting. Each night after going out, we came back to the hotel and brought our drinks and snacks to the  fire pit along the pool and enjoyed sitting around the fire. The backdrop was the strip and was the perfect setting.  We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Vegas!","605":"Great Mexican food! Very clean establishment! Wonderful and friendly service. This place is now my # 1 choice for GREAT Mexican food. My family loved it so much we ate there again in less than 24 hours and tried different food to make sure they didn't have something we may  like better. We didn't, because the food and service was just as good as the night before. \nI will tell everyone I know about this place, they deserve my advertising!  5 STARS!!!!!","2023":"I lived in NM for almost 5 yrs and really fell in love with green chile! The 1st time I went, I ordered the stuffed sopapilla with green chile pork verde. It was incredible!! The pork is fork tender, perfectly seasoned, and the green chile has a great flavor and heat as well. Have been back many times and have had no complaints. I have had the tacos, sliders, burritos, and simply ordered the pork verde with green chile. All is amazing. Never had the red chile- I'm strictly a green man! If you like authentic New Mexican cuisine, this is the place for you!! If you want Tex Mex or Americanized Mexican- go find somewhere else to eat as this is not the place for that.","4867":"Two dozen oysters were so delicious we ordered a half dozen more. The lobster rolls are decadent and enough for 2 people to split (especially of you've just shared 30 oysters). The bourbon\/grapefruit cocktail is divine-- not too sweet, not too strong. Finally, the decor is after my heart. The mermaid statue in the corner seals it. Go!","7318":"Great place. The staff is very friendly. The price is a little hight but it is worth it. Most stuff is 100% guaranteed for life. Fly fishing area ( I am a fly fisherman ) is AMAZING. this is the only place i buy fly fishing stuff. Totally worth coming.","5303":"If you're looking for a gourmet cupcake in Tempe, this is the place.  It's a little expensive, but it's that kind of store, so no big surprise.  I agree with the other reviewers that there is a lot of frosting (almost the same height as the cupcake itself), but it's heavenly if you like frosting and get a flavor you like.\n\nI had a strawberry cupcake (the one with the strawberry butter cream frosting, not the strawberry cream cheese frosting) and the mojito flavored ones.  I really loved the strawberry one.  It was very light, frosting and all.  The mojito one was so-so.  Hard chunks of lime rind and wayyyyyyyy too much mint flavor in the frosting and cake.  It should be renamed mint. \n\nA friend had the cookie dough one and said both the cake and frosting tasted like actual cookie dough.  She said it was amazing.\n\nAll their cupcakes are beautifully decorated, which is nice, especially if you're getting one as a present for someone else.  Some times the people in the store (employees, owners or other customers) can be very pushy, which is a major turn off.  But I haven't had that experience every time I've been there.\n\nThe Tempe location is supposed to be getting some frozen yogurt added to their menu options soon.  That may help those who need to mellow out so much frosting.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who wants a little sweet fix and are in the Mill district.","7138":"This is the first AZ location for this chain and it just opened a couple of days ago. Unfortunately, I'm left with mixed impressions about my first experience here.\n\nIt's a casual restaurant where you order at the front and then you can either eat inside or get it to-go. I went the to-go route and ordered their taco plate. Prices are pretty good, with the taco plate running around $7 for 2 tacos and your choice of 2 sides. I got the grilled fish taco and grilled shrimp taco, both in the soft option (which means you get a soft corn tortilla). For my sides I got their rice and black beans.\n\nFirst off, the tacos were good. They're unique in that they use feta cheese which adds a nice saltiness. The shrimp taco was my favorite of the two -the shrimp were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked.\n\nWhere they missed the mark though was on the sides. The rice was undercooked to the point where some of it was still hard, which completely distracted from any decent flavor it had. The beans were good flavor wise, just watery, which I don't love... but this would have still been ok except for the fact that I found a hair in my beans :(\n\nTheir hot sauce is good though and was a nice surprise. I would have loved it on my rice if the rice wasn't undercooked. The hot sauce has a tangy, almost-buffalo style quality to it, with just the right amount of heat.\n\nSince this is only their first week being open though, I would be willing to go back and give it another try and hopefully some of the issues will have been worked out.","7247":"Yum.  Can't say enough about this buffet.  Great food for the price and the line is long but better then like other high class buffet lines.  What other buffet gives you free drinks. Not soda...but like beer and wine.  Yep, all you can drink too.  Sushi can be better but hey....free beer and wine.","1790":"This place was great about 2 years ago but clearly things have changed. \n\nYesterday on my lunch break I was craving Carne Fries. I ordered them with NO guacamole, ADD extra cheese. I was charged for the cheese too because the total was $10 something. \nI get back to my cube at work only to find that the fries were smothered in guacamole with a less than normal amount of cheese. The carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy.\nNot to mention the cashier was a tad bit cranky AND she never advised me of the fee to use my debit card. \n\nSorry Vaqueros but I don't think I'll be coming back.","3303":"Dr. Chris Choi is an excellent chiropractor and has helped me and my wife remain healthy and pain free. His approach towards total health is some of the best we have experienced.  He takes the time to fully understand your unique health situation and his treatments are very effective. I am also a CDL driver doing a lot of physical work, so regular treatment has helped tremendously . I highly recommend Synergy Health Clinic.","2326":"Boardwalk Equities owns this building. Stay away. They recently pulled all the managers from their buildings, so no manager on site and no manager ever- you have to call in. Building getting progressively more dirty, janitors and other maintenance staff just sit around on their cell phones all day doing nothing. \n\nFor this kind of money you are better off renting with a company that cares about their buildings with a real manger in the building office. OR what I am doing is just going to rent a condo, new everything, in suite laundry, great gym, super quiet and I have a manager there all the time- for the same money.","797":"My MacBook Pro stopped running and so I took it to Bob at 702 Computer Repair. He diagnosed my problem immediately (bad hard drive) and gave me a time and cost estimate to repair it. Not only did he come through for me very quickly just as he quoted, he moved all of my files over to the new hard drive and even upgraded my OS for me.\n\nMy computer runs like a new machine. I saved myself a lot of money and frustration by going to Bob and I am very happy to recommend him to all of my friends.","4086":"Love this place. Great atmosphere and cocktails. Just what Vegas needed.\nWhat's next Moss?","1224":"Excellent Kona coffee. It's very hard to find Kona coffee that reminds me of my vacation in Hawaii. This place is spot on with the Kona coffee. Friendly owner and staff. The place is warm and inviting. I love coming here!","8003":"One if not the best restaurant in Toronto. Everything they do is done with style. The service and food is authentic, crafted and exceptionally well executed. The bigoli pasta is my favourite. However the pizzas are top notch also. Highly recommended.","3150":"Bobbette & Belle are well known for their cakes: wedding cakes, cupcakes, special occasion cakes, event catering... the list goes on! Their cupcakes and macarons really drew me in as they are some of my favourite desserts, so I couldn't resist but to try them. With my hubby, I tried one of their cupcakes and some macarons on my first visit, and a year later (I moved to Montreal soon after my first visit), I tried some of their baked goods and tea.\n\nOverall, our visits to Bobbette & Belle at Queen St. East were mostly pleasant, but the service we've received could definitely be improved. During our visits, the servers weren't the friendliest because they kept cutting us off amid us ordering. In addition, it got rather confusing when the cafe was busy because we had difficulty trying to figure out who was in line to order vs. who already did vs. who was waiting for their order. Apart from that, you're able to enjoy some yummy desserts and drinks with complimentary wifi!\n\nWe visited them on a Sunday afternoon, and man, it was busy! All the seats were taken, there were people lined up to order, and well...so some of their best sellers were gone. On the opposite side, there were a huge array of baked goods and cakes. They had my favourite alfajores, tarts, cookies, cakes...I have some of the hardest decisions to make when I am in here because I truly love everything they make and sell! From their baked goods section, I tried their alfajores and one of their apple caramel bread pudding to share.\n\nSome drinks that we ordered at Bobbette & Belle were an americano for my hubby and some tea for me. I couldn't pass up on trying Sloane Tea, a premium brand of tea located locally in Toronto, because I've been eyeing them ever since I moved away! \n\nI chose the apple caramel bread pudding to share because I love bread pudding and also because I love anything apple in my desserts. Now that you know my love for apple and bread pudding, you can probably imagine the excitement I had when I was finally able to try it. Overall, there was only one thing I wished they did to the dessert: warm it up. The taste of the dessert was great; in fact, it wasn't overly sweet or unbalanced. However, I was disappointed at how difficult it was to cut through the bread pudding because it was cold. Perhaps I should ask them to warm it up next time.\n\nWe always try macarons when they're available, and Bobbette & Belle are no exception. We tried their 'Heavenly Cream' flavour which is modeled after Sloane Tea's signature Heavenly Cream blend. This tea is one of their best selling teas and so I tried it at Bobbette & Belle, and I was in love. It is a rich black tea with hints of vanilla and it is very creamy and smooth when you drink it. The tea has become one of my new favourites and I can't wait to buy some...after I finish my tea stash at home. Anyway, the macarons are very, very good: light, crisp shells with soft insides which are velvety smooth! It is actually one of my favourite places in Toronto for macarons and so it's definitely in my top 5 places. The alfajore was also very good as well, soft shortbread cookies with thick caramel which I absolutely adored.\n\nWhen I try cupcakes, sometimes I'm disappointed to find that they're too sweet for my taste. At Bobbette & Belle, that was not the case! I was slightly worried with all the chocolate inside such a small cupcake, but it wasn't overly sweet at all and I was definitely loving it. It was rich in flavour, the notes of hazelnut were light but still there and overall, everything was well balanced. That is what I call a good cupcake!","5865":"They completely maimed me.  They over charged me $70 for a mani & pedi, with shellack on my finger nails only. They also charged me extra for the razor- which is completely unheard of btw- only to razor off my feet, scrub absolutely nothing & take off all the healthy skin. I had a gash on my left foot that was painful to walk on for three days after that. The manicurist left a nasty gash on my right hand, under my middle finger that split and bled. The shellack chipped after two days, I was so disappointed. Praying their tools were clean & that they didn't give me hepatitis... I will never come back to this place, ever!","3342":"This is a bad or can call worst buffet in my life .... Does everyone tell you this is a good place to eat .... Please don't trust them\nDon't waist your money to come over here it's a dirty and nasty place in Vegas ... I don't know how they can stand on business ...\n Food taste are salty and .... No words to tell....\nService wow is horrible .....\n\nI am so regret to step into this place ..... I really want to get my money back .... If possible....:(","5843":"I was here last night with my husband. We loved the food. It's amazing. They have quick nd good customer service.","3940":"Fantastic brunch\/breakfast place!  Traditional dinner setting with no pretentiousness. Huge portions and fresh ingredients. Not exactly a cheap diner but you do get your money's worth. Also fast and friendly.","3460":"Super friendly & a variety of yummy pancakes :) love love love  EGGS 'n' @!!  I Love the owner Kelly, she is sooooo super Awesome !! Stop 'N' eat Yinz Guys","2675":"If it's your first time buying a home, beware!  Once the sale is complete and lot is accounted for, Pulte Leaders completely disengage from the process and this caused several missed deadlines.  We love the location and community but will never recommend Pulte homes to anyone.","3092":"I usually go to a different salon, but this one was on my way so I decided to give it a try.  I was charged $43 for a pedicure that left me reaching for my pedegg when I got home.  My feet are so rough they are picking on the carpet.  I was also told to put my feet in water that was boiling hot after I kept saying it was too hot.  I will not be going back and wish I had taken the time to read reviews first.","6180":"Worst service if any Starbucks. Waited in line 35 minutes to place an order, and they still managed to get it wrong. Not worth it. Next time sticking to room service.","2487":"This spot definitely has *better Korean food than other places in Cle. But by no means an authentic experience.  Satisfying for a quick Korean food fix though!","3309":"Jay was the best realtor I ever worked with. Patience, knowledgeable, honest and hard working is what I saw at all times. I recommend him as a realtor to anyone needing these services. Thank you, Jay! You are the best.","859":"This place is so good. It never lets me down. The food is always fresh and piping hot, the  wings are the best and they're big!  I always come here with friends and family and I suggest other people should come to try it out. The beer is the coldest in town!!","7812":"Overpriced good old boys club for baby boomers.  The place has a decent menu with daily specials.  It took our food 90 minutes from order to table.  Larger groups were served before our table of two.  Waitress kept covering for kitchen staff with plausible excuses (burned our appetizer and the kitchen not talking to us). For a meal over $100 for two people and no alcohol this is really atrocious.  Waitress took off the price of the cheapest entree.  Either the kitchen is in trouble or the management is, either way there was nothing special about this place.","924":"The food here tasted good, albeit rather pricey. We ordered sliders, salmon, and short rib and you'd expect small portions but we surprisingly left very full. My only complaint is that the restaurant seemed really dim the night I was there. Other than that, it's a really good place to go in Vegas if you're looking for a nice restaurant without the obscene cost found in a lot of the other places.","196":"C'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que je mangeais des burritos et damn que c'\u00e9tait bon ! J'y retournerais n'importe qiand sans h\u00e9siter !","8851":"Scheduled an appointment to have my hair and makeup done. Walked in and was amazed at the place. Love the decor and the staff was friendly. My makeup turned out amazing and so did my hair. They put some kind of oil scent in your hair and it makes it smell good until washed out. 11 hours later and I can still get a whiff of the jasmine scent. Makeup was $55 and hair was $35. Everything turned out how I wanted and more. They did a fabulous job. Will definitely go back when I'm in Vegas again.","4658":"Great service and amazing food!! Latte was perfect. Got the BC signature French toast which was delicious!","4959":"I have Aqua Blue Pools & Spas servicing my pool for almost a year now. He keeps it very clean and sanitized. Hal the owner respond quickly to all my texts and communicate well about services for my pool. So far he's doing a great job and would recommend.","489":"I recently stopped in and was greeted by Chef Marc, a fun loving owner operator who was a great host and very passionate about his food and restaurant. \n\nI tried the Parma sandwich and was very pleasantly surprised, very fresh produce and the meat and cheese was amazing.\n\nMy coworker had the Meatball sandwich and was equally pleased. He said it was the best he'd ever had. \n\nWe also had a few of Chef Marcs made to order cannolis and I almost couldn't believe how great they were. Sweet tangy cream with a fresh crunchy shell, absolutely perfect.","8706":"Wanna hear a riddle? Ever notice how every one who eats at guys is drunk? \n\nYou give? Because had they been sober they would notice the blend taste of cardboard overwhelming their delectable palates. It s passable at best. But recently they've outdone themselves. I somehow managed to get ill eating that stuff. I ve never gotten food poisoning from pizza before. This was a first.","5806":"Parmi les meilleurs sushis que j'ai mang\u00e9, ambiance super agr\u00e9able, une \u00e9quipe de cuisinier au top.\nR\u00e9veil des papilles yummy yummy.\nAliments frais et","3417":"The ONION RINGS we were served were SOUR!!! The MANAGER who took my order managed to Screw up my order. Then the carhop brought my change back covered in spit. Every time we go to this location they add something to our order! TERRIBLE LOCATION that should be SHUT DOWN.","6759":"Great Thai food, always enjoy the curry and Tom Yum Soup","3918":"First time at this oyster bar and I can absolutely say it was amazing. Food was freshly cooked right in front of you and the pan roast was the best I've ever had. I definitely would recommend this place to everyone","6821":"Stopped by for a quick lunch before a show at the Tarragon and wow, what a pleasant surprise! Awesome food, generous portions, great service, and an affordable price added up to a tremendous lunch. I'd go out of my way to visit again!!","7775":"Excellent food and at great prices.  This is one of the best restaurant deals in the Lake Norman area.","4181":"Chef Bob, your salt and vinegar crusted perch is amazing! This is a must try for all fish fry lovers. Aside of that, anything on the menu is worth a trip here. Hidden gem in Monona.","4190":"This place is great! I have purchased many pairs from them since I first discovered this store a couple of years ago. The shoes are still in great condition, including a pair of flats that I wear almost daily. It's hard to find leather shoes that are well-made these days that aren't ridiculously priced, so it was a nice surprise to see such shoes at Young & Tae around the $100 mark...quite reasonable for a well-made leather shoe. I've also purchased a pair of custom shoes that turned out great. I recommend this place to everyone I know!","7277":"Nice surprise. Wanted someplace quick and tasty before a movie at the Manor. Chicken Piccata was well prepared, veggies were nicely cooked and the service was attentive and friendly.  \n\nZio will be on my casual dining list. Decent price, good food, what's not to like.","7117":"Came in for my knee MRI. No problem in getting on the desk.Most of the paperwork was done pretty soon.\nIt's what happened after the MRI that wasn't pleasant.\nI did give my prior MRIs for comparison to the current one.\nBut when i went to collect the report, i realized the report didn't have comparison with  the prior reports i'd given.\nTo fix this, all they did was to have the doctor add an addendum to the report which goes like this \nPrior reports are now available!!!!\nThese reports were always available. You guys just messed up.\n\nAnd instead of writing a new standard MRI report writing everything related to prior MRI examinations in one report, they just added an addendum page in the end giving some findings.\n\nNot a great deal, but i had to take all the pains to visit them again during my working hours!!\n\nThe only silver lining is the price - $295 for a knee MRI w\/o contrast.","6141":"Love it here! We've done celebratory dinners at the Morton's multiple times and we've never been disappointed. Great staff, good wine list, amazing food! Definitely worth a stop in.","6864":"Wow, I couldn't have had a more different experience from Cindy's.  First fyi: the company charges 80 dollars an hour (for two movers).  There is a minimum 2 hour block to use the services.  And there is a one hour driving fee of 80 dollars to initially get to your place.  So, the very minimum the service will cost is 240 dollars.  Seemed pretty reasonable.\n\nI hired All My Sons to move the furniture from a one bedroom apartment to a different unit in the same complex.  The new apartment was about 100 ft away from the first so there was no real driving time involved during the actual move.  All I really needed moved was a dining table, desk, bed, dresser, small file cabinet, and nightstand.  Shouldn't take more than 2 hours, right?  Wrong.  The workers moved slower than tar and continually used my bathroom and drank all my bottled water.  4 hours later, I just asked them to stop and said that I would pay what I owed.  Over 500 dollars later, I was still left with a ton of stuff to move on my own.  Also, they taped shut my dresser drawers and file cabinet doors with a tape they assured me would not damage the paint.  And when I started peeling the tape away, half of the paint came off with it.  They do not take of belongings and they scratched up the entire surface of my 1 month old white desk to the point I had to paint the entire thing over in a dark color.\n\nIf you're in need of trustworthy movers, try to use bekins or another more well established company.  You'll be much better off paying the slightly higher hourly rates for workers who actually work and don't damage your belongings.","248":"Sorry but this place use to be so good when it first opened. The service is not good, and when you order you feel like your bothering them lol. I don't think I'll be back here, it's to bad because I did like it at first.","9010":"I get take-out 3x a week as I work close by - it's so fresh and healthy (they even offer low fat sour cream).    I've tried every burrito place in the downtown core and this is my favorite as it's always fresh and fast.    Line ups are long but move fast ....longer wait for the burritos but super fast if you get an inside-out burrito (no fajita) or a salad (same but with more lettuce and dressing on side)","7940":"A few friends and I took a quick trip to Vegas and stayed at the Golden Nugget.  We found this place on Yelp and after reading some great reviews, decided to try it out the morning we were heading out of town.  What a great spot!  Its hip, has a great vibe, awesome decor (super simple, a little industrial, very clean) and very friendly staff. Service was prompt and the food arrived quickly. I ordered the egg white frittata which was super light, fluffy, full of delicious spinach, basil, and just the right amount of feta and kalamata olives.  My friends ordered the shrimp and grits which were heavenly and the Huevos Motulenos which was hearty and delicious with a red sauce reminiscent of mole.  Prices are very reasonable and the high quality of the ingredients is evident.  I wish this place existed in Seattle. I'll definitely visit eat the next time I'm in Vegas.","1407":"Gym is nice and new. Kids club is terrible and they don't offer enough classes or times. Staff is not that friendly. Canceling my membership for a gym with more options.","9036":"I have been obsessed with this FHS for the last year and a half and have never reviewed. This place is hands down my favorite sandwich joint. The burst of juicy deliciousness when you bite into these subs is simply amazing. Add to that some of the friendliest service ever and a cool Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain and you've got something worth a few visits. FHS, you get an A+. Keep it up!","6778":"Great service, very helpful staff - but very crowded, with dresses and people. The consultants were focused on us when it was our turn for a dressing room, but the styles and space to view yourself in a dress were very limited. Good, but could be better.","2771":"My teenage daughters and I had manicure and pedicures here.  Very pushy in trying to upsell and after being asked 5 times i was annoyed. My daughter had designs on her nails and it was $20 extra and they were not satisfactory. They smeared when they tried to correct around the design and we were still charged full price.  They were so bad she opted to paint over them once we got home.  Several people came in while we're having our nails done inquiring on the pricing and zero stayed.  Too expensive for sub par work.","8231":"The place has amazing noodle bowls! I had the house special and it was delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and let me know what was in every dish. They even have Boba tea! I had the high Thai tea and it was top notch.  My friend had the California poke bowl and it was really fresh. You can even pick your own ingredients for your bowl!","1308":"By far, the WORST STEAKHOUSE in the Phoenix area. Way over priced for the quality of meat you get. My wife and I were here Monday night cause we thought we should try all the restaurant at Nortera. We got the 16oz Ribeye with Ribs. The ribs were mediocre (Chili's is 3x better), but the Steak is awful. We ordered a Medium, yet blood was dripping out of the meat when we cut it...But that's not the bad part, the Steak was TOUGH, bland and .can definitely taste the freezer burn. I am almost certain that the steak was not Ribeye, worst, it may not even be a Cow. Or if it is, it may be a Chuck Steak disguised as Ribeye straight from the freezer to the grill...So to make it worth my while, I decided to ask for some Crumbled Bleu Cheese to put a little taste on the Steak, and the waiter brought me about 2 oz and charged me $2 for it. That's not the end of it, because the Steak was so tough, I was almost choked on it, and our very attentive waiter was taking his time to bring me a refill for my drink, while he chitchatted with his visiting friend behind our booth....Lucky for the owner of this place, I'm the type who doesn't complain, and would still tip the waiter, but will tell the whole world about my experience...My suggestion if you want to try this place, don't have a higher expectatiion than eating at Dennys but expect to pay 4 times more....and have a very strong teeth to bite in their medium rare bland so called Ribeye Steak....","4598":"Hemingway's is a great college bar on Pitt's campus.  During my time in college, I spent many nights here drinking the $5 beer pitchers and $6 dollar shot pitches.   It was a great environment with great staff.\n\nThey also have a great cheap food menu.  The normal happy hour and late night happy hour menus are unbeatable.  Definitely swing by this bar for a good beer, good food, and great friends!\n\nFor a college bar, the seasonal beer selection is quite impressive as well.  In the fall, there is a great selection of pumpkin beers, including my personal favorite Southern Tier Pumking.","3535":"I was so busy working that I didnt get my hair cut, done for almost 5 months, and then I came back to Ippatsu last month.\n\nI have one the best haircuts ever! I just love it!\n\nAbby is so great and she's does a great job listening to me and what I want and is very willing to fix it. Plus a bonus is that shes so sweet!\n\nThey are the best place to get a haircut, color, etc. Even if you like contemporary to unique, they got it down.\n\nEveryone who works there is very sweet and genuine too!\n\nI'm gonna miss this place so much when I move :(","3367":"The selection is great, the prices can't be beat, and the service is wonderful.  Also, when we visited this month, the owner explained to us that items are further discounted when they spend a certain amount of time on the rack.  I'm not sure if that is always the case, but it got me a skirt that would have been $115 at Anthropologie for $8.  \n\nI have not sold to this business, but my friends and I have made some purchases we are extremely happy about!  And I failed to make one that I now regret backing out on.... \n\nDefinitely worth a look to check out the inventory!","1021":"Just looking for a place to grab food and a beer. This place has so much!! And it was good!!!!! Joey was our server and was everything!! The other staff members were extremely nice as well. Beer was good, mac and cheese is a must! They have brunch, they have lunch, they have dinner. They even have bougie cheese platters and I love a good bougie cheese platter! Skip the chain and Bud Lite, try something new and you'll be happy the you did!","3499":"my friends from our condo building and i walked over to this neighbourhood seafood restaurant across from St James Park. Great service and great food. The oyster special was fresh sweet and succulent! The mussels' coconut broth was heaven. The pickerel was crispy and the goal cheese salad was delicious. The shrimp pol boy was not too big but came with a generous side salad. For dessert, we split the black rice pudding and the toffee cake. Just the perfect finish. We spent two hours enjoying the food as well as the company!","1502":"We were there in the afternoon and the place was pretty empty but the food was excellent we ordered the Korean BBQ combo for 2-3 people and it was plenty of food for us, I would say it feeds 4 people. We ordered spring rolls and dumplings as appetizers and it was really good. I highly recommend this place.","7861":"Every time I have been to a church social, mainly for dinners that were put together for the catechists (religious education teacher for those of you who don't know) this was the catering service used. I cannot begin to describe the food to you. It is so good (not as good as a nice home cooked meal) but it sure comes close.\n\nThe eggplant Parmesan is to die for. I had it for the first time about a week and a half ago. I never had eggplant so I was not sure what to expect.  More recently though I was privileged to eat there food again on Friday when I went to the Ordination of the Diaconate at the cathedral. The reception was afterward and they had food that represented the large majority of cultures which I though was good.","5186":"Very friendly atmosphere and the owner was so bubbly and funny. She let us try the rusk and it was delicious. I got Huevos de Madrid and best eggs ever around the old town area.  I highly recommend this place :-) happy hunting","8947":"Searched for vegan restaurants in Las Vegas and found Veggie House.

And we've been coming back ever since.  This is a nice little restaurant that we had passed by many times in the past not realizing the treat that was waiting inside.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for a bite.  The service is quick and there is this one particular server, a lovely young gentleman who went above and beyond to provide a very helpful and courteous atmosphere. \n\nIt goes without saying, but the food is phenomenal and the prices are very friendly to your wallet.  \n\n- J -","4330":"When scheduling for your cleaning, ask for Miss Julia.... She's great!","5851":"I had my birthday celebration here just over 2 weeks ago on June 17. Booking the table for 20 was a breeze, thanks to Emily who was very prompt and professional. Our server Jesse was great, attentive and somehow managed to keep us all happy. He even offered to keep my presents safe, so we could move the party to the dance floor. Special thanks to the security team who were simply class acts. It was definitely a great night and I'll be happy to come back. Drinks were great, no one in my party complained about their meals and we all had a blast. It would be 5 stars, except for the surly DJ.","6259":"The service is good and the quality of the food is way better than the Korean BBQ we've had. One of the best, I would definitely come back.","5616":"We have eaten at Denny's in other states before, and when this one opened in Arizona we thought it would be good. The restaurant is brand new and very nice - however - the food portions and quality were very bad. My husband's eggs were burned and had to send them back. We asked for butter not margarine and we got margarine slathered on our toast. Also, when we asked to speak to the manager they said that these are the portions and apologized for the burned breakfast skillet. Disappointed. Net-net: Go to the IHOP or Village Inn if you really want a great quality breakfast :(","1522":"The manager called me (he was on vacation when this all happened) apologized and refunded my 2nd and 3rd visits.","8051":"National 4wd Calgary got me the parts that I needed, but unfortunately not quickly or effectively.  I ordered mid June and I got the parts mid August, though they were promised by the end of June.  Granted the issue was the manufacturer, but I didn't find that out till near the end, in August.  When I called to ask, and they said they'd call back I rarely heard from them.  I was hoping better as they are one of the biggest 4x4 suppliers in Calgary, but I would've been better off ordering the parts direct.  \n\nBest bet if dealing with them is to make sure that you are in good contact with them, and are patient.  Also, be sure they don't charge your credit card immediately, ask them to take only a deposit, as I was paying for something that I didn't have nearly 2 months ahead of receiving it.","2482":"On New Year's Eve, my husband and I took our boys here while visiting from out-of-town. I grew up in the area and held Sewickley and its restaurants\/shops in high regard, so I was confident in trusting the 4\/5 stars The Caf\u00e9 received from Yelpers. I couldn't have been more wrong in my assumption. \nOur experience was off to a bad start even before we ordered. My oldest son's fingers were pinched by the chair when he scooted in. The pads were detached from the chair frames on three\/four chairs at our table. We asked for ice for his fingers with no apology or concern from the wait staff. \nI love fish and always order sea bass when I see it on a menu. I took my first bite and quickly realized that it had an off taste almost strong like ammonia or a packing solution chemical. Not only was it bad, but it wasn't cooked long enough - mushy consistency for a thick cut of fish. The brussel sprouts (one of my sides) were also clearly from a freezer bag and boiled. Not the quality that I expected from a $28 dish. When our waiter approached the table, I told him that my fish didn't taste right. He stood there and eventually asked, What do you want me to do? I told him that I wasn't going to eat it. He responded with I'll tell the chef and he'll do better job. ??? He didn't offer another dish or to remove it from our check. Another waiter saw me sitting there, not touching my plate, and offered to correct the situation. By that time, my family had already finished and I just wanted to leave. \nMy husband's steak was also flavorless and of poor quality (again not expected from a $28 dish). My oldest son's pizza was made with refrigerated\/pre-made pizza crust and undercooked - unlike any other Margherita pizza I've ever seen. The only one who enjoyed his food was my three-year-old son who ordered buttered pasta. \nWe dine out often enough to know and expect better quality when paying these prices. I'm astonished that this restaurant would have repeat customers when there are so many better dining options.","8228":"The waitress Mariah was very rude and ruined our dinner. All but one person got their food. They went up to the counter and asked her where their food was after waiting ten minutes. She snapped and said that it was coming. Then she proceeded to serve three other tables. Five more minutes went by and they went back up there to ask again about their food. Once again, she snapped and said it was coming. Obviously it wasn't. At this point half of our group lost their appetite and did not finish their meal. After waiting for five more minutes, for a total of 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served, we asked for a refund of the one plate. This was a $70 tab we will never get back and are very upset by one employee's attitude. She ruined our meal and did nothing but stare as one person in our party complained about her attitude. If there was an issue in the kitchen, she should have said that. Aside from the incredibly rude employee, the food was just okay. My burger bun was burnt and that is all I could taste. This was my first time and I will never return. The people with me have been here before many times, but they decided they would not ever return. It was a waste of time and money. She completely ruined our evening.","7781":"Rhino Turf employees are truly the best! Melissa, in Service Dept has a wonderful way of making me feel like (and proves) that when I go in, with my ER issue, that she will do all she can to help me. She is so knowledgeable , patient & kind! Tony, is a mechanic and , as well, helps above & beyond to get my issue figured out! Wayyyyy, above & beyond, so huge thanks to , Tony, too. John, the manager , has also been very helpful & wants to solve the issue at hand. Takes his time and effort to go the extra mile to make sure I can keep running my own biz. They all do, and I am truly happy to have them all as a resource ! Rhino Turf on rancho is the way a service biz should be. Personable staff that truly cares. Btw: I've been working with them for past 3 years and this isn't a one time experience . They have proven, especially Tony & Melissa that they truly  care and r there to help. I highly recommend their service dept ...they have truly kept my biz running at times when I thought there was no hope.","245":"The service was great and there wasn't even a wait to get in on a Friday night. The food however, left little to be desired. The portions were tiny(even for a tapas restaurant). We tried 4 dishes that were just plain bad and enjoyed the bread more than anything else we ate there. I'd say if you go here, go to drink not to eat. If you go to eat you're going to leave hungry and disappointed.","2638":"I had the seafood udon and every noodle, every spoonful of broth, every boiled critter pried from its shell was wonderful. I sat at the bar and the tender could develop a personality, but I came for the food, which was a pleasure.","8826":"Sean is a fantastic teacher. He's patient, knowledgeable, and fun! I'm taking a group class for the first time and having a blast. I would definitely recommend him to anyone interested in learning!!","6564":"This show was so so good. It was fun and sexy and I'd see it again! It's worth the extra cost to sit up front but be careful if you're shy..they pull audience members on stage. Loved it!!!","2283":"I'm a regular at this place and order the same thing over and over. I get the Spicy Miso burger every time. I visit this place so frequently, they know my name and order as soon as I walk in. The Spicy Miso burger is the best burger I've tasted in my life.","2911":"Been to this place a few times, the owners are very friendly. Always happy to share technique\/locations go check them out. Every time I went they would take a discount on the items, for ex. Bought a river2sea s waver list price is $24.99 got it for $23. Fun to talk with the older gents that tie the flies there.","8243":"Karen has been doing my eyelashes and nails for a couple years now and she is amazing! Very professional and good at what she does, I highly recommend trying this place out!","6160":"This dealership is awesome! Chris Graham took great care of me during the sales process! I love my vehicle and had an amazing sales process! I since have had regular service on my vehicle and Velma in service is awesome as well! I highly recommend this dealership and their customer waiting area is OUTSTANDING! Amazing staff of people at Peoria Infiniti!","7880":"I went there around 1 on a Sunday afternoon. There wasn't really a wait and it was so fun watching them make the rolled ice cream. It was so yummy and the flavors are dispersed evenly throughout the ice cream. I can't wait to go there again!","2030":"WOW!!!  By far one of the best dinners I have had in quite some time.  The hosts were polite and our wait staff impeccable.  The food and drinks were brought out on time and everything my picky bunch of foodies ordered was top notch!  I would highly recommend sharing the big punch bowls - so much fun and delicious.  The 80s music went over very well. \n  I would go back to Vegas just to eat here.","8604":"When I moved to Vegas I was hesitant to find a new tanning salon. I tried at least three different places before I found palm beach tan. I LOVE this place!! They have, by far, the best equipment of any salon I've been too. Not to mention the cleanliness. I swear something is always being cleaned while I'm there. \n\nThe staff is out of this world. They make you feel so comfortable and get to know you personally. I had only been in a couple times by the time all the staff knew my name to check me in. I thought that was awesome!! Special thanks to the manager Avy, her customer service is outstanding and always in a great mood. \n\nBottom line, don't tan anywhere else!!","7008":"Wow, I can't believe it took me this long to try Agave. I will definitely be back again soon. Here's the rundown.\n\nThe building looks a little out of place with it's eccentric architecture in the middle of a bundle of chain restaurants. However, once you step inside I felt like I had been transported to another place.  We chose to dine outside and even though the parking lot and busy road were on the other side of the wall, we didn't notice. There is a lot of outdoor greenery, a waterfall, and at least two fireplaces.  Very cozy benches and chairs for outside dining also.\n\nOn to the food: some of the best salsa I've had in a long time. 3 different types come with the free nachos. The guacamole was pretty good, but I could pass on it next time as it was pretty filling.\n\nBlue Corn Crab cake: Outstanding! Again one of the best crab cakes I've had in a long time also. Quite tasty and the perfect sized portion.\n\nThe cocktails were good as well - not too strong but went down well in the warm, outside air. I need to try the tequila flight next time...\n\nEntrees: Taco sampler: GREAT. Crispy, soft taco shells (I know right??! But yes crispy AND soft!). Also had the Tampiquena Style steak: tasty but a little over seasoned (too salty?). Would pass on the steak next time and get more tacos or another dish.\n\nWe were much too full for dessert but there were some tempting options.  \n\nService was a tad slow and not as attentive as I'd like but I've also come to unfortunately expect that in Vegas when there are few other diners outside. The shaded area outside is misleadingly cooler than I expected, likely prompting the other diners to stay inside who wish to avoid the Vegas heat.\n\nOur server did tell us about their great sounding Happy Hour: 4-6:30pm and 10pm - closing every day: 25 cent tacos and $1 mini Coronas.  (can you say bucket of beer?)\n\nI'm confused as to why Agave isn't one of the more hopping late night spots in Summerlin (maybe it is but word of mouth is slow??) since it's got a great atmosphere, decent bar area, great outdoor dining, and the solid happy hour. I'd much rather hang here than some spots at say Boca Park that always seem to be bustling.\n\nThe best part about Agave? VALUE. The prices were reasonable.\n\nI'll be back.","2233":"The 5 stars are for the margaritas that were made for my girlfriend and I.  The bartender made me a fresh muddled blackberry margarita.  it was 110 degrees outside and it was absolutely perfect. There is a reason a margarita takes 5-10 minutes to make because it was AMAZING!!!!  Kudos to her, i cant remember her name but she did say she makes them like she like to drink them which is a nice personalized touch, hopefully she reads this yelp and management puts it on the employee board!\n\nI cant wait to go and get 2 for 1 tequilas on Tuesday!!","8092":"Food still about the same. Not great but passable.\n\nService was lousy, lousy, lousy.  Talk about an attitude from servers.  \n\nCleanliness.  Yuck.  Server picks up glasses from table beside our table.  Pours water in the glass,  Wipes clean the lipstick marks.  Places back on shelf for next person to be served.\n\nPretty sure that is not how its supposed to be done.   Servers would much rather stand around chatting than actually looking after customers.\n\nMost Fox restaurants are about a 3 1\/2.  This one IMHO, at best a 2.","356":"Very good food !\n\n1\/2 off wine on Tuesdays ! \n\nGreat atmosphere !","550":"Oh, how I wish I lived down the street from here liked I used to. Whether it's busy and packed or less populated and quiet(er), its ambiance is totally comfortable and makes it a great place to go with friends for both the bites and the brews. The draft list is long and doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe pizza I cannot really comment on, as I'm always drawn to the choose-your-own sandwich option, and I've pretty much perfected my own monster of a fully illogical-but-delicious sandwich - and no, I won't divulge my greatest secret. I will recommend getting the focaccia bread, as it is easily twice the size of other types of breads and therefore you get more sandwich fillings.\n\nOverall I'm always down to come here, even if I've been recently, because I know I'll get exactly what I'm looking for.","7398":"I suggest that you do not ignore their recommendation when they recommend the lamb dishes to you!! Good atmosphere and good salads. Can't expect much more from a place in a touristy location.","5312":"Was waiting for this place to finally open inside the super G mart international market on independence.  Being an expert of these delish buns and the steamed appetizers shi mu, and shrimp dumplings.  being asian american.  I had the barbcue pork bun and the shrimp dumplings.  they were so Delish ! Fresh ! on the small side.  but still good.  cash only.  price from $ 1 to 2.75.  I m a fan ! will have to try the sweet rice next.","8245":"I am officially done saying I like spicy food at Thai restaurants. I  ordered the Som Tom (spicy papaya salad) and told the waitress they could prepare it at an 8. For the record, an 8 here may in fact make you sterile. \n\nauthentic, delicious and fresh! I'd recommend this place for dates or a small party.","251":"Love this place amazing cheap sushi thats fresh and delish .... People that work here are so nice and friendly. ...","5023":"For my first visit, I went for lunch. I ordered the stir fry fettucini-not sure just how peruvian that combination is, however-I loved the flavors, and the elegance of the dish. Well balanced with just the right ingredients to make an excellent meal. Loved the warm bread and the 3 different butters (not an olive fan, but loved the black olive butter-oh man!)\nNow I would plan to return for dinner definitely and will bring friends, but am taking one star away, I just can't see spending $23 (w\/tip) for a lunch. It was satisfying, but could have been more in the $10-$12 range for lunch, then full price for a dinner.\nNone the less-I will return to try other selections from the menu and am sure they will not disappoint! Excellent food! Looking forward to trying the lamb!","1666":"I just had my wedding at the Orpheum Theatre. I never imagined that I would get married there until I randomly wandered in after looking at the Overture Center for my wedding and determining it was too stuffy. The Orpheum was such a cool and beautiful venue. I have to say that everything came together perfectly in the end, and I could not have been happier on my big day. That being said, I have to say that the journey was hard. The event coordinator was not a great communicator, and I frankly think it is because he needs an assistant or partner because he is too overloaded. At times, he did not answer our calls when we had pre-scheduled conference calls, did not return calls, or emails. He gave conflicting information on several occasions, including price quotes. \n\nI was planning my wedding from out of state, and I did not feel like it was all coming together until approximately the week before my wedding. As a highly organized person, it drove me crazy and made me feel like I lacked all control at times. (I admit this is a personality flaw more than the fault of the venue.) At one point, the coordinator told me that I could have whatever I wanted and then he kept telling me I could not do things I wanted to do or would charge me an arm and a leg to do what I wanted. I felt like he talked out of both sides of his mouth. Our wedding was exactly what I wanted, but I paid for every last tealight candle. I have some of the best memories ever from this unique and wonderful venue, and the coordinator was personally responsible for making my vision happen. \n\nThe food was fantastic. It all came out hot, at the same time, and cooked perfectly.They pulled off an appetizer that we ripped off from the Tornado Room perfectly. Everyone raved about the food and location. The lighting is a bit tough for photos, and the acoustics are hard for music, but if you are prepared and get professional vendors, it is not a problem. Because the venue is non-traditional, you have to be willing to sacrifice some things to have your wedding here, but it is so worth it. People continue to compliment me for doing something so different and special, and I am so glad I had my wedding there in the end.","1904":"Bill has done a bunch of inspections for me.  He's always been reliable and produces very detailed reports with lots of pictures.  He spends a lot of time at the property and also goes above and beyond to answer any questions and discuss his findings.  He's a great guy and a terrific inspector.  I withheld the 5th star because his reports occasionally create more fear and uncertainty than the issue(s) warrant (imho).","3453":"I use to always go to the Wal-Mart in Macedonia  but over the past couple of years, I have seen a decline.  Majority of the workers are so rude, they think they are doing us a favor for working there. Yesterday, I went to a register as soon as I got close they shut the light off, when I went to register 8 same thing. I finally went to a cashier that did not shut her light off ( I wish she did)\nI'm not sure what this girls issue was but she threw my stuff in the bags so hard, I actually thought my milk was punctured. Now I know why they put in self scanners, I will definitely be using them. Maybe if more people do , those entitled workers will have to find another job!!!","62":"Honestly would give it a zero. I dealt with Ti directly to honor their Bridal Show special they offered. She was not professional in her email and text responses and in the beginning gave me a couple hours to make HUGE decision via Email that I was unable to check at work. Therefore, she booked out the photographer we spoke about. Then when she finally set up a meeting, she told me I had nine days to decide on the package with the people we spoke about (DJ and new photographer) and then texted me the next day to tell me she booked out my DJ. What a roller coaster and honestly, it was a great deal, but I would never do business to save a buck with someone as unreliable and inconsiderate of my need to speak with my fiance before making a decision. Would NEVER recommend to anyone for anything.","8467":"This company is great to work with! From the office workers to the techs that come out on the job. They are professional, courteous, and a relief to work with! I highly recommend a phone call to experience a wonderful team who cares about your needs. They take their job seriously and with great care! The work they do is top notch! We have had 3 installations and some broken windows replaced on our home. We will not call anyone else. So thank you Best Glass...for being THE BEST!!!","2419":"My friends had the birthday party there, thus we went there for dinner and party.  It was fun.  Food is great and people are so nice there.  Fast service.   Pretty clean.  We tried garlic chicken and fried calamari.  We love it.   We had fun for karaoke as well.  We already said we would go back again.","7038":"This place is worth a try! They are very clean, nice and give very good pedicures! Went in for a gel polish and noticed it was dull in some areas so I went back and she fixed it for free no questions asked! I love that they are willing to please their customers because I can be nit picky at times. The lady Nina who did my mothers nails did a FABULOUS job as well. she definitely takes her time. Give this place a chance! :)","4532":"Took my girl's car here to get it tinted. They were very quick, efficient, and friendly. They did a very good job.","8609":"This is a great dental office. I have been going here for years. The staff and Dr. Dunn are very courteous. I don't have to wait long and I can get an appointment soon.","6330":"I went for my first ever Brazilian Wax! The staff were kind about it and didn't cause me to feel awkward at all. A private waxing room was in the back. The one staff member (too bad I don't know her name) answered all my questions and she really helped me get through the service by talking to me and encouraging me to breath and press on. I had a good experience with her service and the salon itself is very nice.","7158":"We saw this little restaurant last week, and had to check it out just seeing the pictures on the window! The food looked excellent & not your average street taco\/burrito fare. We came, we ate, and we just found ourselves a fantastic Mexican restaurant! Not only that, it's BYOB! Next time, I'll post pics!","2669":"I love this team! They have helped us buy\/sell our personal homes 4 times over the last 6 years (we moved a lot due to our employment). They always keep our best interests at the forefront of each transaction. They've also helped us rent and sell our investment property, kept us appraised of the market so we could make the best decision of when to rent and when to sell. If you're looking for a west valley specialist, this is your team!!!","6294":"I am not a singer by any means and I still had an amazing time. George was a wonderful host checked in with us on several occasions and when I asked if he could make a rum and coke he suggested a soju & coke and it was delicious. The appetizers were at a good price and tasted great. Definitely will be back on our next trip.","7829":"So I thought I would never do a Boudoir Photo Shoot until I saw our friends pictures.\nWe live in Hawaii and I never heard of a Boudoir photo shoot. \nI'm 40 years old, mother of 3 and a Mimi of 2 grandsons.\n Our Friends photos are so gorgeous ( not like she's not) but I asked my husband if he would let me do a photo shoot like hers.\nWe already had our Vegas trip planned for our 14th anniversary and my husbands 40th birthday.  I emailed La, and got a quick response and the dates were available. Yay for me!!!\nSo I started getting all theses outfits for the shoot and since I was doing this for a gift to my husband, I  brought up his racing jacket and Harley Davidson theme shirt (sexy right) \nLa kept in touch with me until the day of the photo shoot, and was very, very helpful.\nDay of photo shoot what a amazing experience.  All I can say is WOW!!!  Gave La the outfits and she worked her magic.   \nHer team was awesome and so out going, and made me beautiful. \nWe received the email that my photos were ready to view.  My mouth just dropped in belief that these were photos of me, yes me.  Of course the Hubby loved them.\nI just got my album and  we can't stop looking at it. \nAll I can say is WOW!!  \nNow La is considered a new family member to us. Would I do it again, of course.\nIt was a great experience working with La, and her honesty.\nLa took awesome photos of me, who can ask for anything better.  Beauty in my own skin!!!!","7892":"I love this place for breakfast alot of fruit on the plate fresh canadian ...smothy strawberry banana  and my st lucia creps yummy raspberry alot of raspberry sweet cheese yummy try u will love it service fast friendly line up on the weekend during the week just fine try banana blast banana nutella yummy","6504":"I enjoy wing stop and even more at this location. Great customer service, food is done in a great time and always clean.","6184":"I have tried every single item on their daily menu -because I'm in denial since they have nice touches to the food, a cozy sitting area and friendly service-.\n\nThe main dishes, salad and soup are average. Their morrocon, egyptian, indian and greek dishes were average or at times below average.\n\nTheir perogies -but not enough to go back to them- and cakes are great but they I go for the chocolateria next door so they lose on that account","7790":"I was treated to an awesome dinner here last night.  The service was outstanding and the food was incredibly delicious!  Before the server took our order, we were given a basket of yummy sweet bread with olive spread.  I couldn't get enough of the olive spread, it was so friggin good!!!  I had Butter Squash Tortellini as the main course...but before that, we had an appetizer, flat bread with Portabella  Mushrooms on the bread very tasty! While we enjoyed our dinner, I was able to see a tiny view of the fountains putting on their show!! This place would be an awesome place if you want to impress your date or anyone for that matter!","3331":"I love this place. Food is amazing, afordable and service is awesome. Love you guys!","341":"Very glad I found this cafe on Yelp.  The food is fresh and delicious- and fast.  The staff is friendly- it feels like a neighborhood cafe.  I will return when in town again to try more selections from the menu.","4173":"Cindy Williams was the worst person at uhaul I've every worked with. She was rude and made me feel as if she didtnt want me there at all. Not to mention I waited ten minutes before I got helped she performed her job as slow as possible and wanted me to make her JOB easier. Never in the service industry have I see a worker ask the customer for help. I've used uhaul a lot but this will be my last time here!","2192":"I recently had a birthday and as part of the celebration my partner ordered a cake from Scot's. The cake was beautifully decorated and tasted delicious. I would highly recommend them for any of your dessert needs! I should also mention we split a cookie and it was fantastic as well!","2822":"Purchased a gift certificate for a complete detailing as a Valentine's Day gift for my husband.  The paint on his five year old black car was not looking great.  Lots of minor scratching everywhere and swirl marks from past poorly-executed wax jobs.  Brad was a pleasure to deal with in every way.  Very friendly and personable, and flexible with scheduling.  When he inspected the car originally, he expressed confidence that he could make it look great.  Like brand new, he said.  We picked up the car yesterday, and WOW.  Brad didn't overpromise.  The car looks brand new, inside and out.  Carpet and leather immaculate, and the paint looks like black glass.  All scratches and swirl marks gone!  You might find a cheaper detail job, but you won't find a better one.  I highly recommend Deluxe Detail.","5010":"My wife and I had the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Wrap wrap (2) with potato chips and drinks.  The chips were more than good, they were FABULOUS.  And the wraps were nearly perfect.  OK, I can't think how they could have been better.\n\nThe only bad thing is we're traveling through to see my cousin Tom in Tucson on our way home to Santa Barbara.  But you can be sure I marked this place so I can return easily next time I'm in Phoenix.","8682":"Awesome food, great service, memorable experience!","6271":"AN ABSOLUTE MUST DO IF YOU TRULY LOVE YOUR DOG!\n\nMy boyfriend and I have a 5-month old German Shepherd puppy who has been and currently attends training, playtime, and grooming sessions here. \n\nTraining: Matt, the owner of Romp, instructs all the training classes and we could not be happier with his training with kindness method. There are many ideas about what German Shepherds should be and do act like, but both my boyfriend and I found it truly important to make him the sweetest dog possible. We do not want a robot dog that loses all personality because of training via being broken. Romp exceeds our expectations every time with this regard as, while learning to be obedient for safety and fun, our puppy grows his personality each and every week! It is amazingly spectacular! \n\nPlaytime: Matt's highly professional and super caring staff always make our puppy feel loved and missed every week. It is almost like its his second home here, where all his friends live too. We absolutely love receiving his report cards at the end of each playtime, telling us what his pawsonality, what his favorite activity, who his best friend, and any room of impruffment was that day. FYI...he's a straight A student so never any room for impruffment here, but the staff will let you know if you need to work on something with your dog. Our puppy adores these play sessions and comes back exhausted from his long day of fun. I do have to say that I always speak to Savanna and she is the best! \n\nGrooming: Amanda always makes him look so cute! She really does a terrific job and has over 20 years of experience! What more can you ask for than that? Our German Shepherd puppy is extremely unique that loves being clean and looking his best, but tends to oppose being brushed and groomed at home. Somehow, I still do not know how!, Amanda gets him to not only tolerate these activities, but to want to be brushed and groomed all day long! It is so strange, but I am super grateful to her for her sixth sense!\n\nEvery where we go and everyone who interacts with our puppy always says how well behaved and what an outstanding temperament he has and it is in huge part due to Matt and his A team at Romp!\n\nAll in all, if you have a dog and have not taken him or her to Romp, you are doing a tremendous disservice to yourself and your pup. In other words, you would be crazy not to try this place! I can go on and on. \n\nThank you Romp!","6217":"I'm a fan only because Lou's was used as a location setting for the 2012 movie: Jack Reacher.\nThere's a scene where Reacher is on the phone at a gas station and in the background is a wrecker with Lou's phone number on it. This must have gotten past the director and producers as typically any visible phone number (or phone number recited) always starts with 555. I saw the movie on-demand the other night and couldn't resist looking it up! So....looks like Lou's is famous for another reason!","255":"I have been going there for more than 5 years. Great Nail Salon....... Everyone is very friendly ,professional and they will get to know your name in no time. If you don't want to wait make a appointment. Great Clean Salon!","3382":"Went around 5pm but the place wasn't too busy. Pad thai and kao soi were good. Got them spicy and they were manageable.","4047":"Nate and the team served up an excellent evening, great food and service. Way to go team.","4405":"Restaurant is moving to another location soon.  I'd call ahead to see where they are","3423":"Phenomenal workouts--I can see my abs again for the first time since college. Rich keeps my muscles guessing and growing. If you want an athletic build without the injury risk associated with crossfit style Olympic lifting, this is the place for you.","6585":"This place would get 5 stars from me but about every third time we go the food is bland. It appears to depend on who is in the kitchen. Most times the food is great, the service is always great! Raymond is awesome.","7634":"Don came out, gave us a fair quote, and did a fantastic job.  I feel like our home is much more secure now to his wonderful product, so it was a win-win for everyone!  I highly recommend him!","3096":"What a pathetic food. we went here to celebrate birthday. Ordered biriyani, which is so tasteless not even worth of touching it. There chilli chicken is one of the worst I ever had in my life. We were there before, but looks like it's a rapidly going down. I should say this is the worst food ever tasted in a while. Watch out if you want to venture out into this place.","1055":"The stacked chicken and tenderloin Alfredo was amazing! The male server made the night complete.","4068":"Hier wird Qualit\u00e4t \u00fcber die Menge definiert. Riesige Portionen, die sehr satt aber nicht wirklich zufrieden machen. Nicht wirklich schlecht, aber halt auch das typische Mittelmass und amerikanische Austauschbarkeit. Abgesehen davon: Sehr, sehr typisch amerikanisch, auch wenn das Lokal versucht s\u00e4mtliche Italieneische Klischees zu bedienen. Manchmal mischen sich zwar spanische S\u00e4tze in die Dekorationen an der Wand, aber ist ja alles Europa.\n\n\n Am Nachbartisch eine ganze Hochzeitsgesellschaft. Las Vegas.","8810":"Great food and very family friendly.   The service was exceptional. Eric was the best!","4667":"Food is good! Service is pathetic!!! Make sure you visit there at least one and a half hour before their closing time because after that they give damn about how you feel about their service or food, their only concern would be reaching home on time! \nAlso, can not believe that they do not accept American Express card in these days! even a small hawker accepts it!","6608":"Hands down the best sushi spot in Vegas! Such a nice crew and the food is amazing! The 911 special is SO GOOD!! Everything tastes so fresh and flavorful! The atmosphere is very welcoming and Juliana really makes you feel at home. Kay is such and amazing waitress and Sean is THE BEST sushi chef in Vegas. Love them!","114":"After hearing about Guillaume from other local merchants who were raving about it, I decided to see what all the fuss was about last year.\n\nNot knowing what to order\/what their specialties were, I asked the server to give me the best of both worlds- one savoury treat and one sweet. I got the baguettine with cheddar fort & figues, as well as the white chocolate brioche... the baguettine looked as delicious as it tasted- crispy melted & burnt corners of strong cheddar cheese combined with chewy fresh figs baked into a marvelously crunchy yet fresh as can be bread- YUM! \n\nI wasn't sure what to make of the brioche just from looking at it, but upon tossing a piece of the moist crumbly 'challah'-esque bread into my mouth, my taste buds honed in on the hidden rich white chocolate found in just about every morsel. I was pleasantly surprised & have gone back several times for this particular and somewhat eggy\/chocolatey treat.\n\nI have since been back to Guillaume dozens of times, trying just about everything on their racks.. and I love that they have samples of their goods in little bowls by the cash to get you hooked on things that you perhaps normally wouldn't consider ordering- ie potato bread! Delicious, moist and salty by the way...\n\nMy one disappointment however, and what I think should be a point of pride in a Montreal boulangerie, is their croissant. To my taste, I found them way too sweet... at first I thought it might be the day\/batch I had ordered but upon re-ordering was met with the same sweetness.. I believe a croissant au beurre should be just that- no added sugar please and thank you.\n\nI've also ordered their sandwiches in a pinch- which were pretty tasty (it's hard to go wrong with fresh bread, creamy brie & cold cuts) & LOVE That they have Montreal's Crudessence Kombucha beverages for sale.\n\nTheir demi- miche has become a breakfast favourite in our household- toasted to perfection with a smear of salted butter= perfection.\n\nAnd yes, those sticky caramel apple buns are insanely delicious- you will be licking every last ooey gooey bit off your fingers.","2799":"There seems to be many Angelina locations in Vegas, but reading Yelp, I opted for the Charleston branch. It's located in a shopping plaza and the inside was surprisingly really spacious. There's carry-out or diners can choose to order restaurant style and sit at a booth or table. It's really more of a casual restaurant. I ordered a white pizza for the family and it was huge! Best of all, it was super cheesy and creamy. I've never described pizza as creamy, but the ricotta on the white pizza was just spectacular. There was plenty of spices and the crust was my favorite part. Nobody could stop eating this pizza!\n\n Angelina also offers appetizers, pastas, sandwiches, and etc. They have an online website with special deals if you want to check that out.","6841":"Big Daddy's, the first place we take family or friends when they get into town. Whether we want apps or drinks, dinner, or just dessert, Big Daddy's always tastes fresh and the service is always awesome, I think because they're having so much fun and they love the food as much as the rest of Charlotte. \n\nBD has quickly become one of our favorite go tos. From the nachos, to the amazing Mac and cheese appetizers, to the fresh salads with scatch made dressings, to our favorite the Sam I Am, a beef burger loaded with pesto, Rosemary ham, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, you can't go wrong. I recently decided to try a new burger and went with the frenchie on a whole wheat bun. It was a turkey burger with Brie, granny smith apples, applewood smoked bacon, garlic mayonnaise and it was awesome, but for me the part that made it so good was the waitress. She could see me trying figure if I wanted to try it, and because it happened to be one of her favorites, she stood behind it. No worries, if you don't like it, I'll get you your favorite. \n\nThey have a fully stocked bar, great beer options, and the best milkshakes, spiked or not. \n\nOf course when you try a new restaurant you may want some help with the menu, at BD they always ask if you've been before, they want you to take your time and enjoy whatever you choose. It's a simple menu, but there are so many options, even the picky eaters can find something to make their own, due to the burger options alone: portabella cap, veggie, beef, turkey chicken, pork, and I even believe I'm forgetting one! Try it, you can't miss, but be prepared to wait a  a moment or two, because it doesn't matter the day or the time, Big Daddy's is always busy!","8678":"I am a fan of this place. My then-boyfriend (now husband) brought me for lunch on our third date, and I was impressed (well, by him and by the foods I had). Our favorites are: the bread, grilled squid with arugula salad, black fettucine with lobster sauce, and capellini di mare (angel hair pasta with seafood in spicy tomato-based sauce).\nWhy the bread, you may ask? The bread is soo good, we always ask the waitress to give us extra to take home. Just like most Italian restaurants, you dip it in olive oil, black pepper, and permesan cheese, but the combination of the bread and everything else is sooo delicious. And filling, be careful not to eat too much or else you'll be full before the foods arrive.\nThe grilled squid is not always on the menu, but you can always ask your server for it, and they usually will make it for you. The fetuccini with lobster is superb, and quite unique. It's spicy and savoury and creamy. The angel hair with seafood?Good good good (although now I think the one from Tutto Pasta is slightly better and tastier).\nif you are a student like me, come during lunch hour, because everything is cheaper (though smaller portion, but the lunch portion is big enough for me).","6052":"This is our regular go-to place for taking a stroll and relaxing.  We are dog lovers so enjoy watching dogs playing around as well.  \n\nAnother plus until now was the free parking area next to the boats- unfortunately the city has now installed parking meters there. grr...","9040":"The waitress ( short  one length hair with black uniform) is so rude and uneducated. Didn't want to argue cuz she might spit on our food.","5753":"Great and fun place.  The owner is super nice and yes, they do shout welcome to you when you walk in, he he he.  I like that they have a LOT of specialty rolls, that keeps things new and exciting.  Try some of their deep fried rolls, freaking awesome!  The place is always packed.  You can easily get stuffed here.","7945":"I lived in NYC for 20 years and can honestly say this is some of the very best food I've ever had! I've been twice now, and the short ribs tonight, completely sublime! We also had the scallops with corn succotash - really out of this world. The prices are beyond reasonable, and quality is absolutely top notch. The ambiance and decor is elegant, yet cozy and warm. This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland by far!","2388":"Had Jason come out and take care of my weed problem in the backyard to keep the HOA off my back. The service was friendly, professional and quick! They arrived on time and got straight to business. The backyard looked immaculate when they were done. I would definitely recommend them for any yard work you may need! Awesome!","2686":"I'd heard they had the best burger, and guess what? They did.  I had the blue burger which was fantastic.  Everything was perfect about the burger, although I wouldn't mind if it was bigger.\nAlso, it took 4 minutes for them to bring it, faster than McDonald's which was crazy.\nI highly recommend anyone to go there and enjoy their awesome burgers.","5148":"I had the lean brisket, which was tender but dry. The plan was to add bar-b-que sauce onto the meat but bottle dispensers were stingy with the sauce. The sides were good, but not outstanding. The lack of even a paper plate to put your meal on was the final straw. For the money spent I will not be going back to Rudy's.","7168":"I've been going to Pure & Simple for years and also use many of their products. \n\nI love the fact that many of their facials come with relaxing arm, leg or scalp massage. Heavenly. Note - your hair may get a bit oily during certain treatments, I always schedule mine at the end of the day before heading home from work. But the scalp massage is so worth it. \n\n Love the fact that the products are natural and not tested on animals. They don't product push, just make recommendations and give samples first if requested. They also have monthly specials on both product and services. Monthly e-mail to keep you in the loop. \n\nIt's not a fancy spa, but it's great quality and service.","2197":"I will be recommending Michelle to everyone I know with a newborn! The pictures she took came out better than I could have imagined. She had such patience with my daughter while waiting for her to fall asleep for the shoot, and seemed like she knew every trick in the book to calm her down. I don't think there would have been a situation that Michelle could not handle and still get amazing photos from. She truly exceeded my expectations.","1973":"Don't try anything on the lunch menu. My husband ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, but he was told that the ham was still frozen, so he should choose something else (red flag... but we already paid). He ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. The menu description says it comes on a ciabatta roll. The microwaved piece of chicken came pretty much drenched in mayonnaise between two pieces of white toast and some lettuce. They don't bother to cut the sandwich in half, or serve it with anything (someone else mentioned chips? no chips here.) Sadly, he just threw the whole sandwich away... I ordered the BLT - because you can't really screw that up, but this place came pretty close. Pre-cooked, microwaved bacon on white toast with some bad tasting tomatoes and lettuce...\nStick with coffee, or the pastries that aren't made there, i guess.","5596":"As someone who's lived with scoliosis from childhood years, I know the value of a good massage therapist. Finding Victor Kouznetsov has been a long time coming. Unlike many massage therapists who perform their work merely following certain routines and patterns, Victor has an amazing ability to tune into his patient's body. He skillfully detects the problem zones, and then, with a high level of mastery he works on diminishing and eliminating the pain out of those problem zones. \n\nYes, I feel wonderful after his massage therapy sessions. But what is even more important, after these sessions, my back has become straighter and more flexible! I couldn't be happier! Well actually... (at the risk of sounding like a TV commercial), as a bonus, Victor did make me feel ever happier by giving me a facial massage, after which I noticed that the deep wrinkles surrounding my nose and mouth smoothed out. \n\nThank you, Victor, from the bottom of my heart for your great work! And without hesitation I recommend him to anyone who's looking for A MASTERFUL MASSAGE THERAPIST!!!","2880":"Best mocha in town. The Matador is hands down one amazing drink! The vibe is great and food is good as well. Definitely on my rotation now when I'm in the downtown area.","8207":"I loved the SmokeShack burger and the cheese fries! I have to refrain from how many times I eat here every time I visit Vegas.","5869":"Literally stole about $800 from us when we purchased 2 sessions and wernt thrilled with the 1st one.  We wanted to be refunded for the cost of the 2nd session (we had to pay upfront) but they refused!  I went through hell with them emailing back and forth!  \n\nIn the end we had made some progress with the shock collars and our dogs were walking nicely but there was NO progress with the agression AT ALL!! In fact Im not sure they know how to handle real agression!  Spend your money on a CD set, dont waste your time, sanity and money here for real dog issues.","8425":"I have been looking for a good barber shop for a good while now. I've been to A&D Barber Shop, and they're a good group of guys but one of them in particular can't cut hair that well. And for a $19 haircut and not to F*** up my hair every time I had to leave. Than I went to 12th Street Barbers, once again a great group of guys, but not what I was looking for. Than I stumbled upon Public Cuts N Styles and at first I recommended it to my brother from the reviews and he's been there at least 4 times already and has been more than satisfied every time. I went there for the first time today, and I got my haircut by David. He's did a great job at giving me the cleanest cut I have ever gotten to date. Not only was he good at cutting hair, he was a great person to talk about the bullsh*t that goes in my life. He's into guns just like me too, so that was a bonus. I highly recommend anybody to go there and give them a shot.\n-Alex","593":"I went to buy chicken wings (splits) today and of the 2 lb only 3 were the mid section. What a rip off. Quality isn't even that great. I'm never going back","7068":"omg the chicken burro with no salsa fresca enchilada sytle green with no garnish is the best ever! i would have it every day if my waist would allow it..... :) i also love the green salsa they have with chips... much less money than the big resturant and you can order togo and take back to work..yummy!","4443":"I would give this place no stars if I could but I can't. We have been calling all morning finding places to get married at. The man who answers the phone is extremely rude. First let's tell you they charge 500 to get married at the Las Vegas sign. Yeah 500! First off there are at least 6 other places in town that you can get that for 100. Go some where else! Do not do business with this company. When we told him that was a little steep he commented back that there is also a Mc Donald's and inn n out in town that we could go get married at. Extremely rude and unprofessional company. By the looks of other reviews they seem to have a wide variety of complaints. We are actually having our big wedding in Tahoe at Zephyr's cove next year but wanted a typical Vegas sign wedding. This company should look into finding someone else to represent them. To be told to get married at Mc Donald's or a fast food restaurant is out of line and uncalled for.","5749":"Our experience at Big Earl's was fabulous! It's a quaint place in Old Town that is BIG on service and flavor! I had the Yucatan pork sandwich and my husband had the regular pork sandwich. The buns were swishy and so fresh, the seasoned fries were \ntasty and the shredded pork to die for! I don't think we've had better anywhere! Give it a try... You won't be disappointed!","5355":"Awesome Bar! Location is great and it is far better than the bars nearby. \nStaff are good looking and well knowledgeable on drinks. Happy Hour Is by far the best in the Valley.","1359":"Started off rough but Mark stepped up and met the problems head on. He has been very helpful in finding the right house.  I will give an update after we stay at the house and can confirm how well things went","5399":"I wish that I could take all the stars ever given to this restaurant away. We just spent 2 hours waiting for our food only to have our server say that they lost our order. 2 HOURS! Drew came out and wished that he could make it better, but had no solution. I will try it again if they decide to actually bring me my food this time.","7717":"I have known Steve for many years. When I retired from my day job a few years ago and changed to my new career as a writer, I needed to have some professional photos done for my new website. Steve is the consummate professional. He makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. He encourages collaboration and has excellent visionary skills, sensibilities and is very creative too. Did I mention he's a fantastic photographer? We took random inner city photos. When I got the photos back, I was impressed! To say he exceeded my expectations is an understatement. Steve, Thanks for a job well done! \n\n- C W Wiederhold","8529":"As we walked in (my bf and I) we were greeted by the hostess and asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area or table. Of course we sat at the bar since we decided to do the all you can eat since we don't really do the specialty rolls we just do the plan sushi. If you love the specialty rolls they do have a wide selection.\n\nOrder up:\n4 orders of Octopus\n1 order of Uni (so I finally decided to try it and it's totally not for me; It really taste like the ocean.)\n4 orders of Baked Green Mussels (good size)\n5 orders of Surf Clam (my bf really loves surf clam)\n1 Order of fresh water Eel\n1 Order of the Hard Rock Roll (not too bad) \n1 Order of Oysters (delicious)\n1 order of screaming orgasm (I've had better)\n1 order of crab salad \n1 cheesecake \n\nSo yes you can say we got our money worth. AYCE $26.95 Dinner $20.95 Lunch and just add $5 for all you can drink (domestic beers). They also really do time you because the chiefs tell you that your time is up and you can't order anymore (happened to the people sitting next to us). I know the rules for AYCE but every place I have gone to has never said that to anyone. \n\nOverall the service was good, no wait time, clean, and the food was good. So yes I would recommend this place but if you have a big crowd I wouldn't be so sure because if you do decide to do AYCE you might not get your money worth since they do really time you.","2714":"Thank you Wayne and Shannon! They did such an amazing job cleaning my tile and grout at a great price. I am so pleased, highly recommend!","3895":"I really wanted to like this place but sadly I can't.\n\nI dined in once & ordered take out three times.  I can say with certainty that service is consistent.  It's horrid.  I expected to wait as this place is always busy.  I just didn't expect the attitude - at least treat your customers like you want them to be here.\n\nWhen I ordered take out, I'm ignored me in favour of people behind me. I was a little taken aback the first time and thought maybe I wasn't standing in the proper place.  The second and third time?\n\nWhen I dined in I was expecting to have a nice, relaxed lunch with a friend.  My soup was barely warm when served.  I was willing to let it pass but thought I should mention it to the waitstaff so they would know.  She acted offended and stayed that way for the rest of our meal. \n\nIt's a shame really as I enjoyed (most of) the food but hate the service.","293":"Wow, Gareth and crew really know their stuff! I fancy myself a computer guy, and even double as a Linux Systems Administrator in my current job, but couldn't for the life of me figure out what was making my computer go so slow. Prior to booting the computer up, Gareth and one of the other employees already had a couple of guesses based on the symptoms I gave them. They had to hold my computer overnight, but in less than 20 hours I was called with the exact problem and a solution. \n\nIt turns out my hard drive was busted from general wear and tear (I've had the thing for exactly 5 years) and Gareth gave me a few options on how to fix it. He has a very reasonable price plan for diagnostics, labor, and parts, but in the end I figured it's time to put this outdated hunk of technology out to pasture. From what he told me, he also helps with tablets\/phones and does windows\/macs. We have a variety of all of these in our house and now I know where to go if any of these start giving me issues. I live in the centennial area and have been severely burned by the repair shops up here (I'm look at you Friendly Computers and Laptop Xchange), so it was a breath of fresh air to find Compudoc. \n\nWho would have thought there could be an honest, skilled, and reasonably priced service anywhere in this town? By the end of my time, I was merely charged for the diagnostic for my system (no hidden fees or upselling). I really appreciate how quick this service went while not sacrificing quality along the way. I will definitely be back to the Compudoc the next time my computer gets sick.","8512":"First time at this location, stopped for an oil change. Robert helped me and asked if I had any concerns with the vehicle so I explained a few issues I was having. I returned an hour later and he told me he was going to walk the car with me. Interesting... I've used numerous competitors and have never been shown issues before.  He walked the entire vehicle and pointed out everything that needed to be replaced and explained why. My oil change cost me $3200 and I couldn't be happier because my car drives amazing. He even offered to hold the old parts in case I need them for my warranty. Top notch service. I will drive across town to do business here again.  Thank you Robert!!!!","4418":"A friend invited me to go out to Bobbette and Belle and I am so glad she did.\n\nI ordered a hot chocolate and a lemon cupcake.  My drink smelled wonderful and it  came with an enormous toasted marshmallow.  \n\nI'm a sucker for items with lemon but often disappointed once I taste it.  (That doesn't mean I won't eat it - I just won't get it again.)  I loved my cupcake.  It had the perfect amount of icing.  Every single bite was delicious.\n\nMy only regret is that they are not nut free.  On the other hand I won't have to share with my child. ;)\n\nThe decor is so pretty and I felt comfortable and welcomed.  I will definitely be back.","8359":"This used to be one of the better places to go in gibsonia. The menu changes and staffing changed have hurt this place severely. I do like some of the recent renovations but each time I've been here since I've had rude and terrible service. I even watched a manager or owner cuss out his wait staff in the dining room while I was eating. Needless to say I haven't been back.","2469":"The staff is great, very friendly and attentive. The common areas are clean and the coffee machine is always stocked. The location of the building is right off the highway and easy for my clients to locate. There is plenty of parking in the parking lot.","7477":"This place is AUTHENTIC Italian all the way!  People are speaking Italian, the vibe is Italian... so much fun to be around. The staff is family and KNOW that menu!  All 4 of our meals were supurb, beautiful and delicioso!  The lasagne was meaty & had perfect sauce ballance. The eggplant parm was thinly sliced and had a smooth texture.  The pasta with anchovies, sardines, raisins and peanuts (think thats right) was a great mixture of different\/uncanny ingredients that paired very well!  I cant wait to try more! Yum!\n\nThis is one of those places that you might over-look because of its location... but we decided to try it and we will most definately be back.\n\nFor those bad reviews that touted poor service, or no hours, this is not an Olive Garden. Get over it. They can do what they want... it seems like they have enough repeat business.","4559":"I ordered a gender reveal cake from Pink Pineapple based on the yelp reviews and was so pleased with the results. Originally I had planned to take my husband out to dinner and do a private gender reveal with the cake, but when I saw how gorgeous the cake was I felt like it had to be shared with more people. I threw a last minute gender reveal party and the cake was such a hit! It was beautiful and delicious and was a wonderful way to commemorate this event. Nancy was easy to work with, quickly saw my vision for what I wanted and was so sweet and thoughtful in the execution. She even surprised me with an adorable laser cut out cake topper that said Oh Baby! that was perfect!","1703":"First time going there today. We had Original ramen with pork soup and Black ramen with chicken soup. \n\nFirst of all, both ramen were just average. Nothing exceptional. The soup is hot enough, but the noodles were a bit too hard to my taste. The eggs were over cooked. The pork shoulder was small. \n\nAnd then, they charge $1 extra for the pork soup, which in my opinion doesn't taste much different from the chicken soup, except more greasy. \n\nPaying $10.50 and $11.50 for a bowl of ramen this quality, it is obviously over priced. \n\nService was very slow. The waitress was friendly though. \n\nDon't think we will be back.","8918":"Bad food, worse service. Skip it.\nWe went on a quiet weekend when there was plenty of staff and open tables but lack of organization seemed to be rampant. The food really wasn't anything special and the service was terribly slow and not all that friendly. Also, the trays that the pizzas are brought out directly on are thenstored ON THE FLOOR\/SIDEWALK once we were done. Absolutely disgusting.","3193":"I was so excited when they built The Hotel Palomar at City Scape. I love the sustainable concept and reused materials and art that make it so unique.  The blue hound kitchen is a very hipster and very kool. Joe and I went there on our date night a few weeks back. I don't know the bartenders name but his handle bar mustache was fantastic I loved his style. This guy was absolutely talented. He wasn't your run of the mill cheesy bartender you normally run into out here. The drinks were awesome and unique... Joe ordered an oaxacan punch he loved it. next time we go we are trying the smith and wesson.","4496":"Used to be fantastic, 2007-10. Because of that we keep giving it another chance. It is terrible and bland now. They shrunk the containers, destroyed the food. It's ashame, we ate it for years and now I would rather eat a frozen TV dinner.","3177":"Best burgers and fries. Always extremely friendly and helpful staff. They are usually busy but it always seems to go quickly. They do a great job.","8931":"I ordered the take out poutine with bacon and onion. Took about 5 mins from the order. Taste great.","7921":"It's very rare that I'm moved to write a review and a bad one at that. Most times I just suck up and deal with any bad experiences. \nSo... 3 weeks ago made a reservation online and  called the branch 24hrs in advanced to be picked up at 9am. I gave the person the pick up address and cross st (easy to find).  I'm travelling from Phoenix to West los Angeles for a 6pm appointment to time is important. I received a call at 8am the day of to confirm my pick up location and time (My apartments front office 9am). I was there waiting at 8:50 and by 9am no call no pickup. I patiently waited thinking they might have some delays. 9:15 and nothing by 9:25 I get a call stating that they are there at my office location ready to pick me up. What, why are you at my office I said. All the info I gave to rent is under my home address and I confirmed the pick up address twice. So I was finally picked up by 10am they gave me a 5% discount (saved $8) have me the car with a full tank but noted the paper work with 1\/2 a tank. I returned the car with 1\/2 a tank and they charged me for the other half. They adjusted the gas charges to $0.\nIn the end I had to rush to Los Angeles non stop and just made it with 10min to spare. \nIt would of been much better with an hour or more of time to spare.\nThis location has me thinking twice about renting from them and enterprise in general. I rent once or twice a month for a week at a time on average.\nEnterprise Plus member\nEmerald club member.","8214":"I wrote a review about Dr. Lopez that was not so nice. I had a lot of feelings surrounding my sick dog that resulted in having to put him to sleep.  I am amazed that the doctor saw that and felt the need to call me and clear the air. \n\nDr Lopez called me after seeing my review on yelp and we had a lovely conversation. She was very compassionate on the phone and expressed her sympathy and even cried with me during our conversation. She explained to me a lot of things surrounding that day and really put my mind at ease. I wish we could've had this before my dog died, but her calling me after seeing what I wrote and knowing I was unhappy was very big of her and shows her true character. I would totally give her another chance with another pet in the future because anybody that can do what she did even though someone gave her a bad review and be that caring with me deserves that.  \n\nOn top of all of that, all of the staff there was excellent with us and our dog. They got our boy back to us after only a day and a half. We also got a lovely handwritten card from the staff sending us their condolences. Even though they are an emergency hospital, we thought their prices were fair and not up charged. I just wish that they would have forwarded the message to Dr. Lopez that I left for her to call me before his procedure. Maybe all of the confusion would have been avoided if Dr Lopez would've received the message.","8324":"I was very impressed with Nadia the best waxer I have ever had with the least amount of iratation. I have been to 5 diffrent waxers, will only be seeing Nadia now since I am so happy with the results. She is very nice and will work out scheduling if you need special arrangements. She also easy and fun to chat with.","7491":"The worst mail salon I've ever been to. Before we went in we called and were told they had a special of 19$ for a pedi so we went in. First the guy who was doing my mom's laughed at her color choice like 5 times during our pedicure, when I stuck my feet in the water it was literally scolding hot, they had someone extra painting my 2 year olds toes, well when we were done and ready to pay they tried charging my mom and I both extra money and when I told them the price wasn't right she took my money out of my hand and said she would go get me change. But she took 25$ more than my total, after 10 minutes of explaining to them that they were charging me too much they realized they were wrong, they were also trying to charge 25$ for a pedi when the guy on the phone told me it was 19$ so then she explains we have to pay 1$ for the liner in the pedicure bath (I've never been charged for a liner) after paying and arguing about a price for 10 minutes the lady asks me for a tip and then asks for a tip for the lady who painted my daughter's toenails, seriously who asks for a tip. So I handed them each 2$ and they laughed at the money I gave them until we all walked out. I would never ever use this place again. The worst custody service I've ever experienced.","8662":"No stars. Absolutely the worst stay I have ever had.  Turned down the covers to go to bed only to find the sheets were covered in human hair. Not just a couple,  but hundreds.  It's like the hairiest man slept in them the night before and they forgot to change them. They just made the bed.  I took pictures to prove it.  \n\nI called customer services who said they would send someone to change them. After an hour wait, the maid finally showed up.  We watched as she tried out three other sets of sheets but pulled them off when she saw they were also dirty.  Finally she found some that appeared to be clean and finished making the bed.  \n\nAfter she left we checked the sheets and the did appear to be clean,  although I have my doubts they were. \n\nCustomer service gave us a food credit of $30 for our troubles, but when I checked out I found out the credit was not good for the places we ate. At the time we ate we were told the meal was charged to the room, so we thought we were good to go. What a big suprize to find out we weren't.  So we weren't able to use the credit, and it actually cost us more. \n\nThe room was booked through my company for a convention, otherwise my wife and I  would have left and found a room elsewhere.  I can promise that I will never stay at the flamingo again.  It's a filthy dirty run down mess.  Nothing in the rooms say luxury.  If you don't believe me,  just look at the pictures. If you do decide to stay here,  you've got to check the sheets!","6132":"So, we walk in, rug rats in tow.... it's my birthday, so far the family celebration has included  the fathead four year old's pre-k open house (woo-hoo), and an argument amongst the kids regarding where to take Mom for her b-day dinner - peter piper, no chuck e cheese, no, sister, I said Peter Piper... you get it... my nerves are frayed as we are driving down 16th Street and spy that Gasper's is indeed open - lovely - always up for a new dining experience in Cen-Pho.  \n\nBack to walking in with rug rats in tow.. my first thought - this could get ugly, fast....  They are billed as Casual Italian Dining - but the place is really quite gorgeous inside.  Very thoughtfully decorated - not too much, not too little.  The kids were welcomed warmly and attended to as if they were paying the bill (someday my pretties, someday).  The menu was very thorough and varied, something for everyone - I detected a Sicilian influence.  I went for the Osso Bucco (it's my birthday and I can pig out if I want to)..... the spouse went for the Chicken Parmigina, the rugrats, a cheese pizza, one that trust me, was completely wasted on them... wayyyy too good to be wasted on the same mouths that uttered something about a Piper and a Rat.  The service was outstanding - and didn't skip a beat when the aforementioned fathead four year old sent his bread plate crashing to the floor, the drinks were kept refilled, and seemingly, our every need was anticipated (happy birthday to Mom, indeed!).  \n\nWelcome Gasper's, Welcome.... and thank your for an  AMAZING birthday meal - the best Osso Bucco I've had since my honeymoon in It'ly 12 years ago, the outstanding wood fired pizza, the simply amazing handmade pasta and freshly made mozzarella. And finally, thank you for the the warmest welcome and smiles I've experienced in a restaurant for quite some time now, \n\nand the birthday tiramisu?  quite simply dreamy....","4198":"I went in for my first pedicure with a friend and everything was great.  Clean shop, they always used new utensils. Nancy (Thao) and Whey( Sam) were very friendly and made our experience prefect.  We will definitely be coming back for their amazing work!","5262":"Moved her from So Cal 6 months ago and it took me awhile to find a new place.  I'm super picky about my haircut but don't have to search any longer.  Boris hooks it up with a clean fade every time and the atmosphere is great too.  Just a bunch of guys having a good time, offering beer and giving great cuts.  What else could you ask for??","6628":"Overpriced! Slimy mushrooms! \n\nPicked this place from the reviews here on Yelp. I am not sure if my wife and I caught them on a bad day, but the food is NOT worth the price. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli and my wife ordered Mushroom Ravioli. My meal, while appetizing, was  not worth the $28 they were charging. As for my wife's meal, I do not know how she was able to eat what she did. I tasted a sample of her meal and found the mushrooms were slimy in texture and simply gross tasting. She left half of her $21 dinner on the plate. The only positive thing to comment on would be the service. The staff was very attentive and polite. Unfortunately, good service will NOT bring us back to Sergio's. Good luck to those who try Sergio's. I hope your experience was better than ours.","8321":"I've always ordered from Shutterfly and they used to be good. But it has been a couple of years, so maybe they're going downhill.\n\nThey said something would be shipped here for Christmas, which is why I ordered from them. It's Dec. 30 and it's still not here, so I called them to check. They said there's no way for them to track packages internationally (I'm in Canada). WHAT?! They said UPS doesn't provide tracking numbers. Um... a shipping company that doesn't provide tracking numbers when I PAID FOR SHIPPING?! \n\nThey said they can't tell me if it'll ever get here or it got lost. They did refund my money and ship a new order to another address (the gift was for people who were visiting here). However, we will not get to experience the joy of seeing them open the gift. If it even ever arrives there. \n\nI will not order from Shutterfly again because of how unreliable it is.","15":"I had my windows tints done last March and Stephen did an awesome job for which I recommended him to my sister for her car to be tinted as well and again he did an awesome job for both mines and my sister's car..","6255":"The best burger joint I have ever had! Travel a lot, been to many burger places that claim they have the greatest! In and out burger can claim this, hands down!  The sauce on the burger, is unique and tasty, making this place original!  Smart thinking, placing an order taking outside, making the wait time less!","6328":"Delicious! Best noodle soups we've had outside of Taiwan. The spicy beef is the best! The spicy shrimp was also tasty. You're not paying for ambiance, as your view is the poker tournament area of the casino, but the food is inexpensive and amazingly good.","4458":"This is the hidden gem of Vegas. The girls are very friendly and don't wear heavy perfume, And NO GLITTER! Drink pieces are a little high. But the natural girls make up for it. If you are in Vegas its a must see. And if your wife says she can't find a job she is lying to you. Plenty of openings at chicas!","4316":"I'd never been to Vegas before so my friend planned the trip and booked three nights at the Elara because she had stayed there before and apparently liked it enough to go back. After our stay, however i dont think she will ever be going back there.\n\nEveryday we were having to call the front desk to request for more towels and pillows, since they wouldnt replace them. We went to pool parties during the day and all came back wanting to shower, some girls slept on the couch and there wasnt enough pillows etc. (not a big deal). But after calling multiple times (each day was the same thing) the hotel wouldnt send anybody up with anything and we had to start using face towels to shower! After begging the employees they said that they had noted that we had 20 people in our room and not to bring up anymore extra towels and pillows!! We had some friends who met up with us in our room at one point so we would all go out together but regardless we should be able to have as many pillows and towels as we need, right?! I mean we are paying a lot for the room. Even when the electricity went out in the room and we called for someone to come a fix it, it took two calls before someone finally came up. It was ridiculous! The room was nice and I enjoyed the projector screen in our room but the service was awful. I would never go back to this hotel. Very disappointing.","6771":"Always good! Yes not the kinda place you go on a first date but definitely the place you go to when you want some good spicy portions!","6392":"Their prices cannot be beat. My dog loves the chicken necks they sell in bulk. Only place I go to for all my dog's needs","7067":"There I was a lot of hype surrounding the opening of this establishment.  I was excited to give it a try.  My very first impression was not a positive one. For starters the handicapped parking spots are on the way in the back of the restaurant. After entering the restaurant, I noticed there were many dirty tables and chairs were shoved everywhere.  We decided to place an order even though our first impression wasn't  a positive one.  In retrospect, I'm wishing we would've just left!  We ordered a couple of baskets of the six piece strips which came with fries coleslaw and bread.  The chicken did seem fresh however it lacked flavor. The fries were soggy and cold and the bread left something to be desired as also lacked flavor.  I observed a woman in a wheelchair trying to get around in the strip restaurant and having a very difficult time.  I felt very bad for her as it seems this restaurant is not very ADA compliant.  The staff all seemed very board especially considering it's a new place.  In my opinion if you want great fast food chicken and hot, crispy fries, go across the street to Chick-fil-A!","1672":"The best food we had our entire two weeks in Vegas. We shared 9 plates and everything was delicious! We were a little overwhelmed by the number of options. Also the most expensive meal we had on our trip.","1956":"Good local place for Mexican food. My family has visited at least 10 times since we moved to Surprise and the staff is good and the food portion size is excellent. Only reason not a 5 star is I am picky about my beverage and while they have a full bar, they don't carry Guinness. My wife does enjoy their Margaritas and this is an excellent place to stop if going to the movies or bowling alley.","4749":"My husband and I was craving some tasty Indian food. We saw the ratings on Yelp and Google and decided to give it a try. As we entered the restaurant we were both greeted and was immediately seated. \n\nThere was a few people at this time, which was around 530 pm. The atmosphere was warm and friendly and the seating was comfortable. Seating options include tables and booths. We sat on a booth.\n\nThe menu had a huge selection of appetizers, meat, and vegetarian dishes. I was also surprised to see a selection of asian food like egg rolls and fried rice. We were also given some sort of flat bread with dipping sauce. It has an interesting taste and my four year-old actually liked it.\n\nWe ended up ordering two lambs samosas, chicken tika masala, chana masala, plain nan, and egg fried rice. Our entr\u00e9es came with basmate rice. The food was served in beautiful silver dishes and the amount off food given was excellent. Not only was the food tasty to look at but was also delicious and full of flavor..we tasted all the spices. \n\nOver all, I am giving this place a solid 5 star because the food was great, the service was great, and the price was great. You will definitely dance to the wonderful flavors or India without breaking your wallet. We will be coming back to try the buffet..","3978":"Wow, bought a slice of pie, and that thing was HUGE. This place is a small hole in the wall place I found by accident, but soooo glad I did. I LOVE there Pizza, true NYC, get outta here...\n\nThe Owner is awesome, great guy, and it's not a chain. This is a must try.","566":"Slooooooow service and the place was half empty.  Took an hour to get our rolls, and no apologies. Sushi was okay, nothing special.  Won't go back.","4159":"I went here for lunch as I work in the area and I ordered the Chicken Kabob, half salad and half rice.  The food was very good and came with an extra yogurt cucumber salad which is one of the best I have ever had and I am Iranian, the salad also had delicious pickled red onions.  The meet was flavoured very well and overall I was very happy with my meal and will for sure go back when I need to buy lunch.","8362":"Mesa Grill is one of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants*.  \n\nWhy the *? Well, some dishes are definitely better than others and each dish should be put in perspective. I've heard Mesa Grill is the place for spice. While none of my dishes have been overly spicy, they have been quite tasty.\n\nThis past visit I tried the Creamy Wild Mushroom Grits w\/ Poached Egg. Was the dish outstanding? I wouldn't say it was the best appetizer I've ever had. Were they good grits? They were GREAT grits - in fact the only I've ever liked. So perhaps they weren't traditional grits - if you really love grits you may be disappointed. But now I can technically say I like grits.  Would I get them again? Absolutely. Note the portion is just bit small for sharing than I would like, however.\n\nThis trip, the waitress recommended the Lamb Porterhouse Chops. They were satisfying, but I wasn't blown away so I'd pass next time. I also tried the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which are fantastic and a nice sized portion.\n\nI've had the coffee rubbed filet mignon in the past and that has left me speechless. Fantastic taste and portion. I will definitely be getting that again (that's how I rate my dishes - I won't repeat the same dish unless it blows me away).\n\nI've heard good things about the Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut, which is what I look forward to dropping my fork into next time. If it doesn't satisfy? I'll go back for the filet. If it blows my mind? Read about it here.","6016":"The food in my refrigerator was starting to warm up. Like most people, I have no idea how to access what would be needed to fix the problem, and I'm at the mercy of a repair guy's suggested solution. I called late on Tuesday and they squeezed me in for Wednesday morning. Rom showed up right on time. As alluded to before, I could have been told I needed replacement parts, but fortunately for all who do business with Rom, he's not that kind of guy and he fixed the issue with a minimum service call. The refrigerator works great again, the cost was lower than I anticipated and I will surely be recommending Absolute Appliance to others.","6997":"Went to w burger yesterday for a friend's birthday. They were very helpful accommodating an always growing table.\nOne of my friends ordered the steak sandwich and when she got it it was not what she expected (I thought it was amazing but she didn't like it) and the people from w burger exchanged it no questions asked right away. I was impressed to see this.\nI ordered a beef burger with some toppings and it was exquisite. One of those times that makes you remember what burgers should be.\nI very very much recommend this place for a burger if you are in the area.","2918":"So I'm by no means an expert of Mediterranean food but this place was pretty good. It was my first visit last night with my bf. The restaurant is nothing special on the inside, very simply decorated but clean. \n\nService: great! We had a gentleman at first but then a young lady took over and she was very attentive and came by often enough to check on our drinks and to see if we had everything we needed. \n\nFood: My bf got the kabob plate which I can't remember what it was called but it included a beef,chicken,and some sort of sausage skewer. The sausage I thought was the best followed by the beef and chkn. Bf liked them all and simply loved his food! I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and it was light and filling. And just to add to all the other reviews....the fries really are good!! They are crispy and not greasy at all. Idk what they do but it's working!  We will be back for sure!","7559":"Big disappointment.....Went for early dinner on 3\/20\/13, to avoid the  typical 1 hour wait.  Been to this restaurant 3 times over last year.  Rice for sushi was cold with some parts of rice uncooked.  The raw fish (nigiri sushi) was bad, I think they gassed the fish with carbon monoxide to look red, but bad texture.  Raw fish on nigiri sushi pieces were cut small like they were trying to save money.  Although service at Goyemon has always been poor, it makes it worst when the food was terrible.  We brought 4 guests bragging about this restaurant and our credibility was shot.  I don't think I will be going to this restaurant again when I go for my semi-annual trips to the Orleans Hotel and Casino.","2568":"What a great experience. Sarah at Comprehensive Arms is very knowledgable and a pleasure to work with. Patient also. I was interested in a Kimber but was unsure of exactly which model to get. She spend a lot of time describing the benefits and answered all of my questions over a four week period. Delivery of my selection was efficient and business like. She went over disassembly and use. I am very pleased with the service and highly recommend using Comprehensive for all your firearm needs. AAA!!","716":"Went for the indoor pool in November but never got to use it. \nFirst off, we were driving 8 hours w small children it was 3am when we got nearby never been to Arizona and when we called WITHIN A MILE!! for directions the response to EVERY question about exits\/direction was I have NO IDEA...I \nAsked if they had already charged my card like I'd asked and not just authorized the response was,  I have NO IDEA-I'm not even in front of a computer right now I wished I had asked her to put herself in front of a computer and check but I just thought I would never tell a guest that at the hotel I work. When I got there the girl was so not enthusiastic to be there. No hello or smile- just credit card and I'd- not even please! I mentioned the poor directions I got and she just rolled her eyes and said w a scowl yeah I know who that was. Good to see the FDAs have each other's backs yikes....but it was only 15-20 mins before we got there at 3am so either they just left or it was her\n\nRoom had leaking loose tub fixtures where the whole thing moved if you turned the dial. Bloodstains on the outside of the tub, hair...its pet friendly so maybe that's why the couch was ripped att he seams. Dirty handprints all over the mirror at toddler level, also not sure if it was the freeway or airport nearby that was so loud. \nThey shut the complimentary breakfast down right on the dot they don't waste time. \nI've had better and I've had worse","8175":"Chashu (if i remember it right) soup base was good, the pork super tasty. Staff are very friendly.","6529":"Cox internet keeps going down. Hopiday weekend and can't even watch a movie. No tech til monday, terrible service. If you have an issue at least have people who can do more than tell you to unplug your modem. A monkey can do that. The worst is the rep has you do it after the auto attendant had you already do it twice. They do not even offer credit for no service. Going to change companies after 28 years. I am done.","4800":"Best tacos in Madison hands down! Excellent service. Hand made carved booths from Jalisco.","9105":"Rolling solo or with a sizable group that won't fit in one taxi? One of the airport shuttles may be a good option for you to get your 'ttocks to a blackjack table stat. Parties or 2-3 can squeeze in a cab for a comparable price. \n\nPay for your fare, take your token, and go to your appointed shuttle. If it's not full you may have to wait until it is. I lucked out and filled the last empty seat (even rode up front with the driver), this was choice since my wait-time was zilch. \n\nThe AC was cranked but losing the battle against the desert heat. We had a ride along from a salesman pitching timeshares\/condos with the lure of inexpensive Vegas show tickets. The driver later explained that these guys often give out misleading info to make their offers look enticing: proceed with caution. \n\nOur driver zipped along service roads between the casinos and got passengers to their hotels with minimum fuss. Since my hotel was the furthest north on this route I was the lone remaining passenger for the last portion of the ride so I got to chat with the driver. He let me know which buffet on the Strip was the best, though he much preferred fare OFF the Strip (I feel you). \n\nFour stars to the awesome, amicable driver who knows how to get to all the hotels without setting wheels on Las Vegas Blvd. FYI: the car entrances to the casinos are less impressive than what you see from the Strip. \n\nYou have the option to pay for a round trip, I passed. If you need a pick-up arrange it 24hrs in advance. I opted for a cab to get back to the airport since shuttle pick-up time was ridiculously early for my flight, the time spent visiting was well worth the extra ducats going towards cab fare. Shuttle is CASH ONLY and tip your driver if they are coolio, they really appreciate it.","598":"STAY AWAY!! Carepoint Dental is HORRIBLE!\nFirst of all, they can't keep a dentist. In 4 years of going there we've had at least 4 different dentists. You start out going, make a care plan with the dentist, return for an appointment and the next dentist has a different plan for treatment. Who to trust? Next, 3 different times we have had fillings or periodontal treatment. Each time it must be submitted to the insurance prior to treatment  and we know, upfront, the amount of our co-pay.  Now, for the third time, they are billing us more than 18 months after treatment was completed for a balance, even though we either had already paid our share or were told there was no balance! Every time they change office managers we get a bill for charges that suddenly appear out of nowhere. They double bill and attempt to collect even the portion of the bill that they are required to write off due to contractual agreements. How is it possible that we've been in 4 times in past 12 months, paying as we leave, and now we get a bill for treatment 18-24 months ago?!!! Stay away unless you don't mind paying for the same service more than once. Plenty of honest dentists  in Henderson rather than going to someone who would cheat people.\n\nAs an update; I was able to get the EOB's from Liberty Dental Insurance regarding the treatment they are requiring additional payment (from 7\/15). I also called Liberty Insurance & spoke with the claims manager. She reasserted my belief that Carepoint is REQUIRED to write off the balance because they are contracted to accept the payment made by insurance. We had already paid our portion, in advance. It is illegal for them to be billing us! I'm going to take this to our local news station as a warning to others.","3509":"My husband and I ate here on our first date, so it holds a special place in my heart.  We continue to eat here occasionally when we aren't worried about calories or spending a bit more than usual.  Their soft bread and parmesan\/olive oil to dip in is the best!  I particularly like the pasta dishes.  The tirimasu is also delectable.  I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I will say I've never been disappointed in my food.  \n\nElegant Italian eating without being crazy expensive.  The only negative I can say is that, when it is crowded it can get very loud in there and difficult to have a conversation.  Overall, miles better than Olive Garden or Minneci's (sorry local restaurant I wish I liked you!)","5438":"I found this place through Google like 5 years ago; and I have been going since.  Since it is impossible to wash comforters in our washing machine, I go here to get them done.  \n\nIts located in an older shopping center across Wendys.  And sometimes I hit up Wendys for some nuggets and fries while the comforters are in the washing machine! :)  Every time I go; I see Robert...I believe he is the owner?  He is so nice.  There was one time where I had a lot of nickels and dimes in my car.  And I needed 2 dollars in quarters to complete my wash.  He was kind enough to take them and exchange them for quarters.  \n\nThe washing machine I use requires 19 quarters which is $4.75.  Now, I don't ever recall it being much back in the day or when I was living in CA.  I thought an average wash is $0.75.  Maybe cause I'm using the heavy duty washing machine?  The dryer is $0.25 for 7 minutes.  Normally, it dries in 20 minutes...so only $0.75.\n\nThey have a bench so you can wait, a sink, video games, free coffee, ice cream, vending machines for soda, candy, gum, laundry stuff and a TV while you wait.  \nThis is the only coin laundy place I know of in Las Vegas.","6783":"Well, where shall I start? I booked 2 nights this past weekend and it was going to be my first time staying at Mandalay Bay so my boyfriend and I were very excited. I booked our room through the actual Mandalay Bay website. At check-in, we were told that our room would have 2 queen beds when I had reserved one king. They said that they were booked and that's all they had. They didn't offer any other accommodations and that pretty much we were stuck with a room we didn't want. We were upset since they had already charged the first night on my card and we would lose that if we cancelled. I asked to speak with a Supervisor and the employee simply said,  ok, he will just tell you what I just said.\nI spoke with the Supervisor or Manager and at first he said the same thing but I after I kept trying to make my point, they told us that we could wait a few hours and when a room would become available they would change our room. They took down my number because all of a sudden a room had just became available but they needed about 40 mins to clean it. We waited more than 45 mins and no call back. I called the desk and asked about my room, a female employee said that they could not move us now since we had already checked in! OMG! I asked to speak with the manager and she said that he was on the phone and he would call me back. We were furious! I did receive a call back from another manager and he apologized for all the trouble and moved us to another room. Besides the halls reeking of marijuana and the walls being so thin that we could hear conversations, the room was ok. After freshening up, we went down to the casino in desperate need of a drink. We started to gamble and saw two cocktail waitresses walking by in a deep conversation. My boyfriend waived to them and they said, oh, yeah, yeah, someone will be with you,  they also ignored another customer after us. Another waitress went by and she didn't even stop and told us she would be back...she also ignored the other customer. That customer looked at us and said, is that how it works? Isn't that why we come to Vegas? To play and gamble? I'm just going to the bar and tip the bartender...I'm sure he'll appreciate my tip. \nReally? This place had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED! The check-in trouble, the cocktail waitresses, the bath towels were hard, hardly any tv channels available, it was mainly casino advertising. Toiletries were not stocked after cleaning the room. The whole place reeked of marijuana. We simply went to play and eat at other casinos. I didn't think Mandalay Bay deserved our money. I was expecting much more from this place, but I will not be staying at this casino in the future.","617":"This place is most authentic Italian restaurant you will find in Arizona!  The food is excellent and the service is great too!  Living in New York for a few years I grew to appreciate good Italian food, which is hard to find in Arizona....I found the place, this is it!","1163":"I have played many shows here and seen even more. Place needs an update with sound and the overall warehouse look.\n\nReally it is the only place to go to see great shows in Charlotte.","5207":"I'm new to Vegas. So I don't know that many places to go to or even try. My family and I went and were very pleased. I thought this place was great. Very nice environment  and great food too! A little more than I would like to spend, but you can't beat the quality.","7215":"Just finished a terrific dinner at this great barbeque restaurant.  From the sangria, frozen lemonade and cornbread to the baby back ribs, mac & cheese and coleslaw, it was all excellent.  Service was friendly, portions were generous and food was out very quickly.  The free take away bag of sugar donuts was a wonderful end for a delicious dinner.  Even at 5:30 on a Sunday night the restaurant was full and a reservation helped us to be seated promptly.","3360":"I'm new to the Las Vegas area,and needed some assistance on mounting 2 TV'S to the wall.I called E-Z mounting and they sent out 2 guys,Joe and an assistant,they mounted my TV'S and also did the wire work for my Laser disc,Fire Stick ,and a DVD player.\nI have nothing but but good things to say about this company,and if needed, I would use them again!","1869":"A really nice looking deli with courteous staff was the good point now the bad. We ordered our food and asked for water while we waited. The server placed the water down and just before we drank we saw a big hair hanging off of the lemon. Ok stuff happens new water no biggie. I opened my napkin for my cutlery and on the fork was a big pierce of dried spinach ewwww. Details people. The food was ok don't order the Ruben sandwich the meat is like rubber. The manager comped us a free desert, very nice of her unfortunately it took 25 min to get to our table I guess when you get it free you have to wait longer. Anyway wont be trying it a second time.","4850":"Mathnasium is a really fun place to make new friends, learn math, and have fun!  I have been coming here since August 2015 and I have gotten more A's in math then I ever have before. I have made a lot more friends then what I currently have. The staff is really friendly and helps you actually understand what you are supposed to learn!","5408":"The staff is friendly and not perfect. Mistakes happen, but they take care of you when they do. Coffee is good. Bagels are good. Six cheese is my favorite and the snikerdoodle cookie is excellent. Overall enjoyable experience coming here, with few exceptions.","2531":"Very slow service. I needed a copy of my lease agreement and was told it would take 24 hours. It's been over a week and I still have nothing.  \n\nI eventually was able to obtain a copy from my dealership, but even them and my insurance company have noted that CDLS is absolutely brutal to work with because they're so slow. \n\nRethinking leasing vehicles moving forward if this is the only company dealers use.","7584":"Sure, it's a chain, but you'd be hard  pressed to name another fast food joint that offers up a bigger variety of freshly prepared dishes, fast service, and beer and wine!\nI'm partial to the Japanese Pan noodles but pretty much everything is above average.","2247":"I had to sign up to yelp just to share my experiences *yes plural* about this place.\n\n1. Why would a place offer mango desserts and beverages and never ..I mean never have mango? I challenge you to go there and ask for a mango drink..mango slush mango anyhing... their response we are out my response  when do you ever have it?!?  TAKE IT OFF your menu!!!\n\n2. Half of the menu here uses tapioca..Hahah how can you run out?! On more ocassions than one..they have run out. Epic fail on inventory.\n\n3. They run out of taro...fml...it's just like a potato..the least amount of prep and work\n\nOverall this place sucks taro balls.\nSave your $7 and go to gong cha. Atleast they never run out of anything on their menu","8570":"I've been attending SCC for several years, and can say I truly feel loved by this family of Christ.

We will make you feel welcome.","4503":"Love the staff.. Hate the customers.\nPlease leave your kids at home ladies","93":"The Phoenix Cheesesteak Co. adds a new flavor to the Coronado district, which along 7th St. is home to some of the best local restaurants.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my Westside, a gigantic cheese steak made with portobello mushrooms, bell peppers, avocado, onions, provolone and chili mayo.  The bread was fantastic, as was nearly everything else.  I do agree that the chunks of steak might not be the best idea, as some of them are a little gristly (to the point of looking for pieces to avoid).  That didn't stop me from finishing the sandwich from end to end.  The chili may is delicious... and this is coming from someone whose biggest fear is mayonnaise. \n\nOn top of that, the place is shiny-clean, and the service is top-notch.  I'm convinced I was helped by the owner, and his motivation is clearly to provide the best possible customer service.  I could walk here from home, but it just feels so much better to drive after one of these belly busters.","5538":"I recently purchased a used car from this dealer and not to blame them so much as they have 3 locations. However, their service dept. needs a lot of work. The car I purchase, 1 month ago, was either not checked out at all or those people have no idea what they are doing. I have had to: replace the battery, air filter was disgustingly filthy and long past due to be changed, no washer fluid at all, coolant needed added to and sway bar bushings on the rear of the car were shot and had to be replaced. They supposedly took care of the noise in the rear (bushings). Will never recommend them to anyone. When told them about the battery, i will say, they did send me a check for 65.00$. Battery was 120.00. Return phone calls   are next to impossible to get. Never again.","8353":"Don't know what would make it any better... great sandwich... they make the steak almost right in front of you, it taste great, they have cheese wizz  but it isn't on the menu? Great!!!","5576":"Our taxi driver from the airport said to come here (as did my travel book) and that 6 months from now we will be craving the smoked meat sandwiches. We stood in line for the restaurant for a while, but opted to go to the take-out store next door. We were very glad we did that....the line moved fairly quickly and we got seats at the back  of the store.\n\nWe had 2 smoked meat sandwiches, a pickle, and poutin. It seemed like the take out area was the only place to get poutin. We hadn't tried it on our trip yet, and I thought it was probably a good spot to have it for the first time. The sandwiches were the perfect size. We originally only ordered one, but one wouldn't be enough to split for lunch. It was a very good sandwich, but it was not any different than good deli's in NYC. The poutin on the other hand was heavenly. The gravy was rich and tasted of beef, and the curds and fries were very fresh. I will definitely go here again, but mainly for the poutin. If you don't get to NYC frequently, then I will say you will definitely love it for the sandwich. Like I say, since I can have Katz's or Sarge's in NYC any time, it didn't seem much different. Here's hoping that America adopts poutin!!","5360":"Food & service was great. Prices are good & they deliver! If you haven't tried them you must go for lunch!","3906":"Booked an appointment Sunday afternoon called ahead they prefer reservations. We were two and there were two very nice ladies taking care of us. They immediately asked us if we had already seen the movie playing, she actually put a new chick flick on for us that we ended up watching until the end. They put plastic bags in the foot bath to maintain hygiene. The environment was very classy and comfortable we had a good time. The staff was very friendly we didn't feel awkward as the ladies didn't converse in their language they spoke English. It was $35 for mani and pedi but separate $25 for feet and $15 for mani both with choice of colour. BRING CASH!! Save 10% and ask for a stamp collect 10 $25 off. We will be back, stones are designs are extra $5 (design for 2 toes). They provide you pricing and are capable to create all designs just show them a picture.","1386":"The ramen is awesome and the prices are great, you get a lot of food for your money. The broth and noodles are tasty  ! \n\nThe spicy miso broth is super good and you get a lot of toppings and a hand roll for $10! \n\nThe young lady who served us was very nice and helpful. \nDefinitely coming back.","1429":"I have been taking my elderly mother to Complete Care for some time now.  I truly love how they treat my mother and I.  My mother who is up there in age, really feels very comfortable in seeing Dr. Hererra and his staff.  They show her respect and compassion.  When I have a medical issue with my mom I call Valerie and she helps facilitate what ever issue I may have in regards to my mom, be it medication, in need to see Dr. Hererra, or any medical condition my mom may be experiencing at the of my call.  Valerie responds in a timely manner, she is the most helpful of all staff (outside of the doctors, of course).  I am so pleased with this facilty that I have recommended other family members to them.  I don't go to Complete care only because I'm already established with my PCP way before I found Complete Care for my mother.","9009":"I can't even imagine how much chicken this place goes through in a week.\n\nAnyway, the chicken teriyaki is great. They marinate their chicken and have a tasty balanced sauce that goes on top. I think it's only like $6 for a plate which is plenty for one person.\n\nSometimes they're a little inconsistent with portions and cooked-ness. They cook the chicken in large amounts at a time, and when it's done they keep it on the grill so I think sometimes some of it gets overcooked.\n\nI can't speak for the other things on the menu, but I probably wouldn't get anything except the teriyaki.","1995":"Wendy is the absolute best!!!  Please visit on Saturday through Monday. She's friendly, fast, and keeps it all under control. Easily the best local bar in Scottsdale.","1446":"First time...   Order three things - 2 different beers listed on the board and one food item from the menu and they were out all 3!  In addition very non-friendly staff!  Would not recommend!","2476":"As a business owner, I realize that mistakes are sometimes made. But having the owner of Tru Cab read my original revue, contact me in person, and then promptly and without question refund my money... well... that says a lot about such things as principle, integrity, and honesty. Based on Larry's quick response to make a bad thing good, I would give Tru another chance. Not only that, they'd be on the top of my list.\n\nQuoting one of my favorite all time movies, You know Lloyd, just when I thought you couldn't be any dumber, you go and do something like this... and TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!!!","201":"Pretty good for an AYCE place.  The portions of rice was slightly more generous, but then again I can understand. Most everything was good and the items came really quickly. I wouldn't recommend the uni, the unfortunately it wasn't fresh on the day I visited. Some of the better items had a limit so make you try the items that have a limit.  Some of our favorite was the salmon belly and the seared salmon. I believe both of these were limited.","806":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but I had actually not been here in a few years. A friend and I walked in at 8:00 at night and were taken back by an extremely fishy smell. This is shocking as they are not a seafood restaurant. We both ordered the Chopped Salad which is a huge favorite but neither of us could eat even half of it as the pesto dressing was solid garlic and it covered the taste of everything else on the plate. I could actually taste the garlic all night and next morning no matter how many times I brushed my teeth and gargled with mouthwash!","1505":"Huge Apple Danishes! Unfortunatley huge doesnt mean better. \nSo what does Westmall Donuts have to offer? Here you can eat a fattening overpriced danish in a horribly old and decrepid space and wash it all down with a lousy tasting coffee.\nDo yourself and your wallet a favour and avoid it!","3044":"Lots of old people here, it's a blue haired invasion in the winter months. But that's kind of Phoenix in general I think. Staff is hit or miss.","2433":"Great place for Brunch!  Friendly staff.  Try the California Benedict you will Love it!","4257":"Just got over a severe case of Food Poisoning from this place. Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY!!!!!","7987":"Good Food!!! Everything is made fresh, the people are friendly, the PHO IS AMAZING!!!!! Best I ever had.  The fried rice is Delicious\nLike sports, well they have the games on!!","6545":"This definitely sets the standard for music store in Toronto. This location is basically 3 stores all rolled into one. There a separate section for guitars, with 2 floors and a separate keyboard section. It should definitely be your first stop for anything music related.\n\nI should mention that the parking lot is super small so parking can be particularly gnarly.","5386":"I've been receiving haircuts from Ellie exclusively for a good 2-3 years now. Her work is consistently excellent and her attention to detail is meticulous. She truly has it down to a science at this point. I can't recommend her highly enough! The Shadow Hills location is cozy and easily accessible from the 215 to boot.","9047":"Let me start by saying I have been here numerous times and the food is a 10. Today, we had the fried chicken which was perfectly crispy, Mac n cheese just like your grandmothers, greens like you have never had before and the amazing cornbread. We even ordered a piece of strawberry and coconut cake to go for our 3 hour drive home. Today, I was beyond disappointed. The service was a 0. The hostess was kind and seated us-I should have left her the tip. Our server came and never made eye contact with either of us. After I told her my order she repeated something completely different. So, I repeated it again as she turned around to check out the guys who walked by to sit at the table behind us. We ordered coffee in which took 10 minutes to get and we were never offered a refill. Actually, the server did not even bring our food and only came back tothe table when it was time to take our plates. Finally, we track her down to ask for the cake and a box to go. She brings the cake but no box and seemed frustrated when I ask for the box again. My boyfriend spoke up and ask for the check. She laid it down and walked off. I decided to pay at the door only to be told to go back to my table and my server would have to take my payment. I told her I didn't want to wait. She said I will have her come up. Then, 5 minutes later she came upset and rang me up and laid the my receipt down and said you can just leave the signed copy here and walked off. Never have I ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip. Today was the first time  I have actually had my dining experience ruined by poor service. I did not leave a tip. It's really a shame because as I said the food here is exceptional but I refuse to go back to such poor customer service.","6484":"I really enjoy this place.  The atmosphere is the best, the food is great and the staff is wonderful.  Thanks to Phillip last night who was a wonderful server.  Only had bad service once.  They keep the patio temperature great no matter what time of years.  Great for special occasions.","4834":"Extremely poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs. Maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurels...if you have breast cancer, the last thing you need is poor service and pushy sales clerks. I would give no stars if that were an option. Stay away.","5589":"Amazing service, food, and prices. Chicken Gyro was delicious and side salad was super fresh!","1307":"I ordered delivery from them today, and I had a bad experience. Not only was part of my order ignored, and therefore I didn't get it (but thankfully not billed), but the driver was pretty rude and acted inappropriately.\n\nThe driver took my credit card from me and cut me out of the payment process (he scanned the NFC chip when I explicitly told him I didn't want that). When I vocalized his error he said I should call head office. Okay fine.\n\nI called Pizza Pizza and told them what happened, and they agreed that the driver shouldn't have done what he did.\n\nI did order a pizza and I did recieve my order but the driver should not have taken his own liberties with my payment processing after I articulated what I didn't want done. I won't be ordering from here anymore.","80":"Best barber shop in AZ! Ask for Damos, he is the best in the business. You wont be disappointed!","7884":"Hey ladies, \nif you're looking for a place to get your nails done PLEASE COME HERE! These ladies are amazing. Wait times if any are very short. The job is beyond amazing. \nI come here for all my nail and eyebrow care needs. They are attentive, and true professionals at their job. \nCOME ON DOWN!","5867":"HORRIBLE FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE -- But hey their female employees are all walking about with body parts sticking and pushing out and thinking they are ALL that!  Will NEVER go back to this establishment !","1607":"The best friend chicken I have had in a long time.  The waffles are different, they have some type of spice mixture in them, not to my taste.  However the chicken is so good we will be going back.  Service was great, we had a lot of attention.","2984":"Excellent stay during a very busy weekend! Everyone on the staff was amazing, but special kudos goes to Chelsea at the front desk and Amanda in the restaurant.","2655":"I brought my family of five to the restraunt  because of an ad that kids eat free. The waiter didn't explain that drinks had to be ordered to get the deal (nor was it on any of the posted ads). Our bill came with a different ad explaining the restrictions. We were charged full price, and left we the explanation that rules are rules. They were complete jerks and were happier following the rules instead of losing out on two drink orders to keep my family's business. Oh, the food isn't much better.","6879":"Great food! Owner personally walked my friend and I through the buffet. Everything smelled and looked great!","2368":"WOW!!!  Enjoyed EVERYTHING from appetizers to desserts. Could not have had better service from Autumn and Chris... Even Executive Chef Paco checked on us to see if we enjoyed everything.  Family friendly.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","212":"I was just in there today, and I had a coupon for $10 off of $40 or more. Now, I shop this CVS store all the time and use my coupons all the time. Normally the staff in there is so nice and always honor my coupons. Not today..I was  $0.69 away from the $40, and she would not honor my coupon...I wish I got her name..I only got the SM name, and his name is Mike...I'm very upset..I'll be making my way back there to return everything I bought, and I'll be shopping Walgreens from now on...","6447":"Dr. Kelby Gale and his staff were all extremely personable and professional. I would highly recommend him, especially for people with dental anxiety. Dr. Gale referred me to Dr. Mark Melde, DMD for a root canal procedure and I could not have been happier with his chair-side manner and expertise. Afterward, Dr. Gale completed my procedure with a new crown all in the same visit. I have recommended them to all of my family and friends.\n\n-Vicky","5105":"The food was wholly underwhelming, from the appetizers to the main dish bland and tasteless all around.  The service was wonderful, attentive, and prompt, and their drink selection was allright.","4441":"Been coming here for years!  Russ is the man and his barbers are solid.  Haven't seen fades and service like this since NYC.  Great people.  Never leaving.","7053":"Great facials here. The owner lady is very friendly and accommodating. \n\nCan't comment on mani\/pedi services here as I've never gotten them.\n\nFor facials, this is the place to go. Very relaxing and zen.","8997":"Average Mexican cuisine with above average prices. Two people in our party ordered the steak burrito, and the steak in both burritos was completely overcooked, past the point of well done. We ate here because we were at the HRC anyway, but I wouldn't come back to eat here again.","2090":"Direct TV has to be watched very closely in their charges. They changed my billing (without notice I might add)--began charging for a sports channel that had always been included in my Choice package while not allowing me to remove that channel from the package. They did this at the same time as raising my Choice package cost by $4 and charging me $5.83 for that channel--effectively charging me $10\/ mo. more for the exact same programming.  Said there was nothing they could do about it, they did it because they can--and I have 10 months left on my contract. I had expected a 2nd year cost increase as the first year incentives expired, but these increases were in addition to those! Also, without my authorization, they had added a 3 mo. STARZ trial which would have cost $13.99 after the 3 mo. trial. I cancelled that immediately when I noticed.  Beware of such shenanigans from Direct TV!","6614":"...the hookah cocktail Stephanie is awful... we  would go an hour without any check up from her. Coals went out twice and ran out of drinks. This was the third time of going to Babes and having her be our hookah cocktail a day it's always the same service. We had to ask the bartender, Jessica, for drinks, and she gave great service. :) thanks to Jessica though!!","6842":"DO NOT USE THESE GUYS FOR CATERING!!!!!! They were to cater a brunch on Sunday morning and never showed up! Or at least not for over an hour. We waited for over an hour before giving up. Imagine! And then when I called on Monday, Kevin was in a meeting and was to call me back. Did he? Hell no. So no food, no explanation, no apology. Disgraceful performance!","8879":"I stay here for 3 days last time it's was okay . I liked that there was lots of places around you . There where food , barbershop a Walmart . The staff was ok. The beds where great they felt so convertible . The Air conditioner work great. The tv was cool they had some okay shows. They would have the house cleaner clean the rooms everyday . We left are stuff out there when we left the Hotel to visit some family members. Nothing was missing everything was there where we left it at its cool that we could had some trust with cleaning lady's","5274":"Been a pleasant experience when visiting Ann Road Animal Hospital! Staff is friendly and we're usually seen in about 20 minutes!","5813":"Bullshit laundrymat. Didn't wash my clothes and the dryers are .25 for 5 minutes.","7321":"I had the privilege of hanging out here during a trade show I had to do in Vegas. The owner Adrian and his cousin Jonas are fantastic ambassadors for the gaming community and a much needed presence in a customer service industry. They welcomed me into their place of business and did not make me feel uncomfortable, even if I didn't spend much money. \n\nI haven't been to all of the shops in Vegas, but after this experience, I don't see a reason to go to any others. The staff was also extremely friendly (David and Trevor), and they even lent me one of their expensive EDH decks to join in a group game. \n\nEven the other gamers were inviting and not cliquish or awkward. This was one of the first times I have been in a game store and not immediately felt like an outcast until I have proven myself in one way or another. \n\nGreat work on the store guys and hopefully you can have many successful years in the future!","4108":"staff here sucks.  it probably took my friend and my drunk ass about 5 minutes to get their attention while standing at only 1 display case.  (i'm sure they get a bunch of me walking around their store but i was literally stationed in front of a display case talking to my friend loudly talking about how i'm not getting any help and looking into the rest of the store at all other sales reps)\n\nwon some good money and it was burning a hole through my pocket.  i probably wouldve bought a wallet instead of the POS of a thing they call a money clip but their service didnt warrant me spending another minute in there.  if i was sober, i bet i would've walked out of there and went to another store instead.","1404":"As a relative newcomer to the Valley, I selected Harris Dental based on their reputation, and over the course of several visits for both routine hygiene as well as a cosmetic dentistry procedure, I have found that their reputation is well-deserved and worked-for by everyone in the office.  This has been evidenced in every interaction I have had with anyone in the office, whether on the phone or in person, from the receptionists to the dentists themselves.  Dr. Joe and Dr. Brian are warm and personable, skilled and efficient, but never rushed.  Their passion and dedication to their profession felt singularly focused on me and understanding the outcome I was looking for with respect to repairing teeth damaged in an accident.  Dr. Brian went far beyond anything I could have reasonably expected to repair the temporary crown I clumsily and thoughtlessly damaged on a Friday evening, meeting me at the office at 11 PM that same night (yes, 11 PM!) to patch me up for a charity event I was supposed to attend the following morning.  Amazing level of service!  Likewise, the hygenist I have seen through repeated cleanings has knowledgeably guided me back to healthy gums with extremely practical suggestions (namely, water flosser) after a few years deferred dental care due to multiple moves left me with sensitive, receeding gumlines.  I'm releaved and excited to be back on track to a healthy smile with tangible, measureable results.  Ultimately, I am very grateful to have found a dental provider that so clearly strives for excellence in every facet of the service they provide their clients.","4014":"He prescribed me medicines and told me to take one tablet a day after dinner whereas...I am actually not supposed to take them more than once a week. also I am not supposed to sleep within 30 mins after taking them but he did not tell me that. The pharmacist was surprised seeing the prescription and she gave me the right information, Then I took a second opinion in another clinic which confirmed what the pharmacist said.I am wondering what would have happened if I had gone by this doctors advice.So please be careful.","2729":"I would do zero stars if I could! Working with Oasis was a terrible experience. First, I scheduled the pick up between 9 a.m.-12 p.m. Then the company called me the day before the move to let me know that my pick-up would be between 2 p.m.-5 p.m. I am upset because I would never put down a deposit if I could not have the time slot that I requested. They said they would give me a $25 discount and they never did. Instead, when the movers arrived at 2:30 p.m. they said that they could not take a part my bed. Why can they not take down my bed? That is what their job is! I was told by the sales person that they could take apart my bed. I told them that I live on the 2nd floor and I let them know how many steps I have as well. They spent 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do! Then they tried to have me sign the contract without deducting the $25 discount that they had promised. I would probably give them negative 5 stars if I could actually. They started to move my stuff, but when I did not sign without the deduction of the promised $25, they decided to just leave and not move my belongings. I will never use Oasis. I hope they shut down! If you need to move, and you hear the name Oasis, then my suggestion for you would be to RUN. Words to describe them: unreliable, unprofessional, rip off, and unethical. I am waiting on them to refund my $50 deposit. They messed up my whole entire day's schedule. I had to take off from work because they could not come in the morning, etc. RUN!!","2172":"My carpets look fabulous! We have pets and children and never thought the stains would go away but the team at A One really worked hard and were able to get our carpets so clean! Definitely recommend them for carpet and tile\/ grout cleaning!","9020":"Run away!  Fast!  Everything breaks in a year and then you have no warranty!  Our microwave broke in 6 months.  Then they told us it could not be fixed and that part always goes fast.  Then Why are you selling this product?  Don't buy from here, go someplace else!","2777":"I got my hair done by Alexis ! She was more than amazing to me and my hair. We started the process for a ombr\u00e9 \/ balayage ! I highly recommend her service. I'm currently moving but I wish I could take her with me! She's the best!","8582":"We enjoyed our cruise on the Desert Princess today. Initially, we were scheduled to go yesterday, but we got a call the evening before telling us that it was canceled due to Highwinds. To make up for the change of plans, they booked us for today and gave us a free photo package. Be sure to ask for the senior citizen discount - if you qualify - for the cruise. We enjoyed being on different parts of the boat and listening to the pre-recorded tour. While on the back of the boat it was more difficult to hear but when we got on the second deck and sat at the front, we could hear much better. We did not have much interaction with the staff while on the boat. The gals in the store\/shop were very friendly and pleasant. I would do this again if I had the opportunity, and I am sure we would enjoy the dinner cruise as well. We learned of a lot of interesting facts about Lake Mead and the surrounding area as well as the Hoover dam.","8399":"A beautiful facility with lovely staff.  Rita was very helpful today.  Fantastic website!  Will update once my pugs get their check-ups!  Welcome back, Dr. Ensign!","6863":"Crystal was very sweet and helpful with my dietary restrictions! Lovely atmosphere and the food was authentic and subtly spicy. Great experience!","3695":"So, living in, or near New Jersey, New York, and Philly has spoiled me when it comes to great food, pretty people, trendy spots, and yummy happy hours!\n\nRnR is one of my new favorite places that mirrors a trendy spot in the Village in NYC.  Upon turning the corner and seeing it's beauty, I was immediately in love.  Once on the other side of that by and beautiful wooden door, I was greeted by a lovely young lady with a pink bang and barely there outfit with great customer service skills.\n\nWe arrived too late to experience the $15.00 bottomless mimosa brunch but just in time for happy hour! Bingo!!!!!!\n\nThe menu had some unique choices and we opted for animal fries, which was about 1\/2 pound of pulled pork over French and Sweet potato fries covered in herbs and aged cheddar cheese, and ahi tuna tacos which were good enough to order again.  As for drinks, the margaritas were banging!!!!!! My friend had a pineapple margarita and then a glass of the Alaskan Amber Ale on tap (good damn beer) and , I had a mango and a chipotle pineapple margarita.  They were amazing, each in their own ways and they were $4.00 each! The beer I think was $2.00.  I will definitely be back here as often as possible but next time with a Designated Driver and an IV filled with H20 so that I can simultaneously hydrate my poor body!\n\nOh, and the service was pretty good for them to be so busy taking care of drunk people who just want to have fun, me and my friend included!\n\nThe music was amazing as well, I almost created my own dance floor! Maybe next time I will!!","4910":"Went there because of the yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Computer wouldn't turn on at all. They looked at it right away without even writing a ticket. Plugged in a different power supply as troubleshooting and it came on. Then they blew me away with it will be ready in a half hour. I came back in an hour and it was ready, cleaned inside and out and a totally reasonable price for a bigger power supply than the original and great service.","672":"I have tried this place twice and have not been impressed. The first time, I ordered a standard gyro, the pita bread had mold on it. The second time, I ordered pita bread with hummus dip, for whatever reason, they toasted the pita bread and it was like eating cardboard, just not pleasant to eat. The hummus was ok, but I will not be ordering from here again.","359":"Deze onderzee\u00ebr uit de 2de wereld oorlog ligt er bij alsof ze ieder moment uit kan varen om op missie te gaan. Het is waarschijnlijk de enige onderzee\u00ebr uit die tijd die uit zich zelf kan drijven en dus gewoon in de haven ligt. Er is niks aangepast om het schip toegankelijker te maken voor publiek, overal staan persoonlijke spullen, servies op tafels, eten in de kombuis wat de ervaring echt ten goede komt. Ik heb zowel de USS Cod als de Rock and Roll Hall of Fame op dezelfde dag bezocht, echter alleen de USS Cod zal de rest van m'n leven herinnert blijven.","1649":"A pleasure to have stayed here. We had a slight hiccup at checkin and Tifanny at the front desk helped us get coordinated. We visit quite frequently and usually we like to stay at different casinos but we will defiantly be back to the Wynn.\n\nHighly recommend this hotel and great job Wynn on having Tiffany on your staff making your guests feel so welcomed. \n\nThank you Tiffany and Wynn Hotel","3824":"Purpose: for work, have stayed here quite frequently (50+ nights)\n\nPros: \n- Check In: always pretty quick\n- Staff: friendly, attentive, and respectful\n- Concierge Lounge: the food is pretty good (i generally have pretty low expectations for the food served at the lounges) and the lady who works there in the morning and the guy who works there in the evening are such great, pleasant people. [I will edit this when I get their names.] Love the smoothies in the AM! Also, when the Concierge Lounge isn't open for breakfast on weekends, they give you vouchers for their AYCE buffet downstairs. \n- Bellboys: very attentive\n- Location: right in the center of Uptown (in my opinion) and close to my work area. About a 5 minute walk to a central bus station and I believe the train station is nearby. Less than 10 minute walk to the Time Warner Cable arena and not that far from the Bank of America stadium.\n- Early Check In: has been granted every time I've come in earlier than check in time.\n\nAverage:\n- Clean & Decent Sized Rooms: not expecting too much here as I really just need the shower + bed \n- Gym: Cardio & weight room is decently sized (for a hotel). Their pool is a standard size. Yoga mats (+ space) are available. Open till 10\/11 PM.\n- Restaurants: I've had decent food that I can pick up from the Champions restaurant, order to pick up time is consistent (~15-20 min). \n\nCons:\n- Rooms: all rooms generally have the same layout \/ I have never been upgraded to a room that's bigger. I've only been upgraded to a room that's on a higher floor. Also, try changing rooms if you're given the rooms located underneath the concierge lounge. Starting at 6:30am, all you will hear are footsteps and chairs moving around. Lastly, beware if you request a room near the elevator as it's generally near the vending machine\/ice room. When they're restocking the vending machine, you're going to have a hard time sleeping through that. \n- Occasionally, super loud people can be heard through the walls\/doors (but this isn't really the hotel's fault...)\n- Occasionally booked solid during busy weeks in Charlotte (they host a lot of events and there's the annual basketball tournament)\n- WiFi: isn't free for non-Rewards members. Also, it's pretty slow for today's standard.\n- There were ~2 times where the fire alarm went off (not during the same stay though) for no reason (we were never told what happened).  \n\nUnexplored:\n- Parking\n- The other restaurant (not their breakfast room and not Champion's)...\n\nOverall: I always try to book my stays here if the rates are within my company's allowable ranges. I haven't had too many bad experiences and my complaints are pretty common across all hotels.","5561":"I ate here a few weeks ago during lunch on a weekend since it's close to my place.  I can safely that I have eaten sushi in many places and I know what good presentation, service and flavour should be. Unfortunately this spot was lacking in all three.  However, I will start with positives:\n-good location\n-portion size for an AYCE is decent.\n\nUnfortunately that's all I have on positives.\nSadly, the service was horrid. There was one other small group of customers there (a table of three) and the server was not very attentive to either.  \nThe chef's lack of creativity was evident in his platting and the overuse of rice and lack of ingredients was a bit disappointing.\nThe flavours were poor and the sashimi sizing was quite small.\nI will go back one more time to see if it was a one-time occurrence and will post if that is the case.  However, for now, I would suggest","6625":"Harker is my choice for servicing and replacing equipment because the technicians have been competent and friendly.  With their fair pricing,  I recommend to friends.","7475":"The manager screams at customers. Stay away and go to Johnny Rockets in the same food court.","5880":"Burger was burnt to a crisp.\nPizza was salty as a shaker full of salt.\nService was nowhere to be found.\n\nNeedless to say, we will not be returning.","7449":"Beef burrito was excellent with black beans! Choice of hot sauces.","7855":"good food at a reasonable price, can be very busy on the weekend with a line up of people waiting.","7167":"One of the most creative and inspiring dinner experiences we have had in the past year.\n\nEnjoyed the 7 course tasting menu: Was blown away by all but one course\nserved family style with the feel of farmhouse cooking\nHighlights\nMackerel in Sunflower Oil\nPotato Tournadoes in Dijon\nSweetbreads\nRabbit Sausage\nBobumRhum Cake w Salted Caramel - Heavenly\n\nOnly miss - but still was seasoned and prepared well - the seared Ahi Tuna - felt like someone dropped off some sushi in our eastern spain\/ western france farmhouse dinner\n\nImpressive and would go back and recommend to others looking for a memorable meal \n\nReasonable price for food and ambiance","820":"Very pleased with my experience there.  I saw April for waxing services.  She was so personable and friendly.  Very accommodating for my crazy schedule.  It was my 1st time for this type of service and April was very patient, answered my questions, made me comfortable and overall created a wonderful visit.  I will certainly be back!","4681":"First time I've had a bad experience at a QT.  Received a few lotto scratchers from a gift exchange, won $22.  I personally never purchase lotto tickets or these.  \n\nWhen taking these tickets up to the counter, the young lady was extremely snarky about I have to scratch the bottom area where the barcode shows them if I won.\n\nI told her I wasn't aware, and she gave me a look of disgust that can't be described.  Never have a felt belittled over what felt like being profiled.","2721":"A very good dinner.  All four of us enjoyed our pasta dishes immensely.  The chef handmade gluten free breadsticks and pasta for one of us and all agreed both were excellent.  And the piano player there on Saturday nights is a star.  Highly recommended.","455":"Nice place to have a nice breakfast for not a big amt of money! I'd recommend to all that is comming to Canada once it's such an traditional store in the country!","5460":"Completely disappointed,  transferring from Washington to arizona with our dtv and century link bundle has been a nightmare.  After over 3 hours in they phone today, but to mention the 3 prior called made,  still no resolution. The supervisor at dtv, Kevin,  was least helpful,  if I had to guess he had me on mute doing other things while I was addressing my concern,  after I stopped talking there was compete silence,  I said Kevin are you there,  he obviously pushed a button because I could again hear background noise, his response was yeah.","5339":"We were sat quickly and in a booth. Our drink order was taken almost immediately. Took a while to place our food order. The chips and salsa weren't great. Overly greasy chips and the salsa was more of a from-the-jar and not homemade. Our food was good. Huge portions so we had plenty to take home. It took a long time to get drink refills...but I think our server was new as he seemed way overwhelmed. I'd return if I were in the area again.","6098":"I signed up for their special deal: $39 for one hour body massage, 45 minute facial, and 15 minute head massage ($120 package at regular price). On my visit, the lady (co-owner of the salon) had booked more clients than she and her assistant (masseuse) could handle. She was constantly running in and out of the little cubicle space they have reserved for facials and massages. In the end, my 2 hours turned into 3.5 painful hours. No one offered me a beverage. When I asked for water, I was handed a water bottle which wasn't even cold. When I asked if I could switch the head massage option with eyebrow threading (which by the way costs $4 less than a head massage at this spa), the not-so-nice Indian lady gave me a hard time with it. She lied to me that she was not the owner and it wasn't in her capacity to change the package that was offered. However, later her assistant confirmed that this lady was indeed the co-owner and this is their family run business so the other owner being her own sister.\nThe spa was not clean either, even though I was their first customer of the day. The towels they used on me were stained and when I complained about it, the lady gave me dirty looks. Also, I wanted to upgrade my facial (from their basic facial to one of the specialized facials they offer) and I asked if she could cut down the time on the massage and instead give me a more customized facial. Again, the lady flipped out and said something ridiculous like, a massage uses only oils which don't cost much, whereas a specialized facial would use up so much product which is really expensive. I have never such terrible service before at a spa, especially for a first time customer. She made me pay the $10 price difference between a basic facial and a specialized one, which I was okay with. But it was her tone and the nonsensical logic of facials using up more product (when in fact massages and facials are generally priced similarly) that pissed me off.\nCherry on the cake, the facial I ended up getting felt more like cleanse, exfoliate, lather on lotion, lather on face oil, dry, put a mask and go home! I mean come on, I can do better than that at home. On their site, they describe their facials as being so highly in demand and being so unique and one of a kind. I expected something more. But it felt like an amateur's work and my face feels no different than before. Not to mention, I left more frustrated than ever before.\nWhen I came home, I went to their regular services menu and did a count of the deal they had marketed on www.dealgetters.com  I realized it was such a rip off. The 1 hour massage = $60 + basic facial = $40 + 15 minute scalp massage = $10. That gives us a grand total of $110. So why did they advertise a $120 package when the numbers don't add up? I now realize they had actually advertised their specialized facial ($50-55 value) and overcharged me for my visit by making me pay an additional $10 + tax + tips.\nI would probably not have given a tip, if it was not for Nadia (the assistant\/masseuse). She is not a certified massage therapist (and not even close to being one) but she was sweet and not rude like the owner of the spa.\nI would never visit again and if you are planning to go, I would strongly advise against it. Half the price that you pay for a salon visit is supposed to be for the ambiance which this place has none of. Its prices are inflated due to its location (Wellesley station - close to subway). In the end, this is just a nail salon, nothing more!","6280":"3 of us came here on a Friday night.  It was difficult to find a parking spot and didn't realize the restaurant was on the second floor.  We got drinks and there's plenty of alcohol.  Didn't care for the lemon one, it was way too tart, but our server offered to replace it.  The biscuits are really excellent. The fried chicken was absolutely AMAZING and the gravy that came with it was awesome !  I got the NC trout, which was good but I didn't care for the dry breadcrumbs in the middle.  One person got the blackened catfish which was probably the healthiest option, but nothing special.  The brussel sprouts were fabulous.  Didn't care for the potato cracklings. We got the Smores chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was really good but would have been better with white chocolate sauce instead of chocolate on chocolate.  For Xmas, peppermint in the white chocolate would be really good !  We'll definately be back.","3557":"Clean place, friendly staff, easy to get to and the food is the best! Like to stop in weekly for lunch.","8856":"I came here with my boyfriend with high expectations for some delicious traditional Japanese sushi but unfortunately, we were disappointed. My boyfriend and I ordered various sashimi and maki rolls. Although the fish was buttery, we felt that the rice left much to be desired; the proportion of rice to fish was off and it felt like the rice was stale (dry). We went on a weeknight and the restaurant was full; seating was cramped. We did appreciate the friendly service the waitress provided but there was only one waitress working the floor thus slow service. Overall, given the quality of the food, we don't think that the pricing is justifiable.","7040":"I brought a stereo speaker in to have a woofer replaced. He had the job done within a day or two and didn't even charge me! It goes without saying that I had a great experience at Galaxie. I would definitely go back if I ever need a more involved repair or am in the market for some stereo equipment.","8789":"You have to be slightly out of your mind to want to do this.\n\nBut that's ok, there are plenty of others just like you... including me!\n\nI died.\n\nAbout 46 times. \n\nIs there such a thing as a 3rd, 4th, 5th...etc. wind? I discovered that there are... or I just dug down and pulled what was left out of any willpower I had to do Echo Canyon Trail, and I finished.\n\nI'm overweight (working on it, give me a break!) and this was seriously a lot of work. \n\nYou may have seen someone sliding down the pole on the way down the trail... yeah that was me. I was too afraid I'd go rolling down it if I didn't decide to slide down on my ass.\n\nBe prepared, mentally and physically. Take plenty of breaks. Gloves can come in handy but aren't absolutely necessary. I highly recommend a camelback for water, it came in handy for sure. Bring a snack with you to eat at the top. \n\nGet ready to climb over boulders, and to constantly think.... oh! I made it to the top!! Only to discover its just another mini peak, and you have yet another half mile to go before you reach the top. \n\nWear sunscreen!! You will need it. A hat might do, but I feel like it would get in the way of seeing other hikers making their way back down the mountain. \n\nI seriously reached the point of exhaustion, and three days later, I am still sore. Even my back was sore after this hike. I also discovered a nice purple bruise on my buttcheek from sliding down some rocks...LOL.\n\nThe view at the top is absolutely worth it. Don't feel like you have to rush just because people are sprinting behind you. Move off to the side and let them pass. Take your time, rushing is only going to get you injured. \n\n\nOnly negatives I have:\n\nParking SUCKS. The lot was full at 8am when we got there, and it was really frustrating because 3-4 cars drove out at the time we were circling around, yet the people in charge of monitoring parking weren't paying attention. Instead of being able to drive in, we had to park at AJ's which was a mile and a half away. Apparently they only open up the lot every 10-15 minutes. You will be better finding a spot to park and just walking, otherwise you will spend more time trying to get into the parking lot than you would walking to it.\n\nIt's not a fashion show. I'm glad a lot of women are confident and proud of their bodies. But honestly, I don't want to look up to determine what boulder I'm going to grab, only to see half of your ass hanging out of your waistband rolled up neon shorts. I also don't want to look up and see your tits hanging out, on the verge of nipple flashing. \n\nSome people brought kids, and it's not really something they should probably be seeing. I'm sure the dudes don't mind, but really?? Go to a strip club if you want to be naked.","6983":"This has to be the worst example of customer service and courtesy I've seen in AZ. Coming from Texas, we appreciate good service and great food hand-in-hand. I believe this place forgot that customers keep them in business. We waited against a wall while the waitresses didn't acknowledge us like we were lepars...we left fast and headed to Taps Grill!!! Hands down...we won't come back and will definitely share our experience!!!","4924":"I used to love this place but it seems to have gone down the toilet in the past few months. \n\nMy husband and I have LOVED their Famous French Toast but the last time we went, the French toast was TERRIBLE! It seems like they changed the recipe or have new cooks who don't know what they're doing. It was caked with cinnamon which was burnt and if you've ever tasted burnt cinnamon, you know how gross it is. When we sent it back, it came with even more, as if they were pissed and piled it on just to get back at us for not liking it the first time. When we told her it wasn't good the second time, the waitress was sort-of apologetic but I think it was her boss (the owner) who made the crap so she didn't want to sent it back again and make waves. Being somewhat non confrontational, we paid the bill and went on our disappointed way. \n\nIt's too bad that we no longer have our beloved JP. There are so many places to go for a good breakfast, you have to hire some decent cooks and treat your customers better.","7035":"Great food! Great prices! Awesome environment. Looking out the window at Guadalupe Road almost makes you feel like you're at a diner in Tokyo.I'll be coming back for sure!","2177":"I had a mixed experience with this company. I am currently 29 weeks pregnant.  We hired them to pack and move me out of a 3-bedroom rental into our new place. In part, I blame myself for contracting with the on nothing more than an email quoting an hourly rate for packing and the move. If they quote you an hourly rate, I _highly_ recommend getting them to commit to a maximum time-frame for your project and have them provide a price list for any packing materials to be used.\n\nThe two men I had for the packing were courteous and relatively efficient. I was shocked, however, at what we ended up being charged for boxes and packing material. Especially, when asked, they could not provide us any sort of itemization for what was used. \n\nThe next day for the move, we had one of the same people and a new person who seemed to be about 20 with very little experience moving. Again, they were courteous and very careful in the handling of our furniture. But they were the slowest movers I've ever used. \n\nIt took just short of eight hours for them to move a three-bedroom house. There was a great deal of chatting between the two movers and hanging out in the truck. The greener of the two movers also frequently hovered around seeming uncertain of what needed to be done next.  I was literally standing over them in the 110 degree heat by the end of it trying to get them to finish. It then took them close to another hour to get hold of the main office and try to figure out the paperwork. \n\nWe had planned to also use this company for my partner's move in two weeks but, based on our experience, we will be using another company.","2964":"We have been using Davenport Diesel for a couple of years now, and we have been happy with them. I am surprised by some of the reviews posted here. Steve has always been professional to us, and he is knowledgeable too. We have multiple trucks in our fleet and I have an invoice on my desk I am getting ready to pay right now. I would recommend Steve at Davenport. \nMike Riggs General Manager Progressive Hardscapes.","3219":"School itself was great and all, but they are all about the money with no concern for a family's circumstances.  After child attended a full year and intended on a second year, the school refused to refund $700 deposit for the second year.  Had to withdrawal (4 months before start of school year; plenty of time to refill slot) due to extenuating circumstances.  Sorry, but we didn't cost the school $700 by withdrawing 2 months after early registration.  Why so hardline on your policy?  If we waited until a week before start of year, I could understand holding deposit. But 4 months notice when you had a waitlist this past year?  Way to treat a disabled combat veteran.  Customer service on par with United and Delta.","1028":"Michelle has been treating me for several years, and she is well-informed on her techniques. She's helped me with sprains, strains, depression, anxiety, digestive issues, in addition to other problems. Michelle is pinpoint in her accuracy, every visit has been tremendously effective. I've never once had a painful experience, always uplifting. I've even been to other acupuncturists, and Michelle is head and shoulders above the rest. She has a natural talent that comes out in her craft. I will be a patient of hers for many years to come!","2900":"I am giving one star because I was completely underwhelmed for the price.\n\nMy husband purchased a pregnancy spa package for me totaling almost 300.00.  My esthetician was wonderful and attentive, however since it was a spa package I had to shower there in between treatments.  The spa bathrooms were absolutely disgusting and shared with the people using the gym, or anyone who needed to use the rest room, there are no private bathrooms for the spa.  There were clumps of hair in the shower and the bathrooms were in general down right dirty.  I then had to walk around in just a robe with people coming in and out to use the gym facilities.\n\n\nMy massage therapist was far from great or professional.  She immediately struck up a random conversation, which was the last thing I wanted to do during a massage.  She went on to tell me about how she doesn't want children or like children (meanwhile I'm pregnant).  She also told me how I was her last appointment and she couldn't wait to be done and get home.  It was very awkward and far from relaxing.  Not to mention the waiting room was directly outside the room I was in for a massage so I could hear everyone talking outside of my room and every time the therapist opened the door there I was laying naked on the massage table for everyone to see!\n\nI would not recommend this place for its spa services.  I think it is better served as a gym and tanning salon.  I also think that many of people who get massages there do so on a monthly basis for medical reasons, this is not a good place to go if you're looking for a relaxing spa day by yourself or with friends... Find somewhere else to go before you waste your money!","6538":"Our room was equipped with the latest conveniences. Top quality easy to understand master pad at the front door, and next to each bedside table. They control lights, including seperate lovely easy on the eyes night lights, sheer curtains, room darkening drapes!  Recharger stations for my iPad were at several locations in the room.  I have a dust allergy, and appreciated how super clean the room was, not a spec of dust anywhere! Plus it really was smoke free!  I can smell previous smoke in other smoke free hotel rooms, but only clean air in our room! I did miss my Nespresso machine, and a good cup of coffee was hard to find, but there was plenty to make up for it in other extras at Encore.  Every employee I had contact with was happy, and each was very anxious to be of help.\nWe took advantage of a special summer offer, and were actually surprised how many visitors were on the strip that time of year.   I was happy we could get away from the crowd at Encore. There were at least double the number of people wandering around Wynn, while Encore was a bit of an escape. The crowds were even more thick at Bellagio where we could hardly get through their garden display.  There were long lines to go through the water tunnel at the garden, so we gave up since there was so much pushing and crowing.  We went to a show at Flamingo where I could hardly breath walking through the casino, the smoke was so thick. As soon as we opened the door back at Wynn\/Encore we could take a deep breath, the air was so much cooler and cleaner!\nI would definitely recommend this hotel.","6560":"Live entertainment as we were served beverages it was so much fun one if the best memories we had in Vegas! Jaw dropping!","5436":"I used this company to move 8 miles from a 2 BR apartment to another 2 BR apt. They gave us an estimate of $400 to $600. The two moving men were nice, and seemed to know what they were doing.  I stayed at the old apartment, while my roommate went w the movers. I hadn't finished packing, because I hired people to help me pack, bc I am disabled, and the people never showed up! 2 Men and a truck did nothing to help me. They took the furniture, and boxes, but not my belongings. They were gone several hours so I called my roommate to see what was taking so long, and he said the elevator had broken, and they had to carry everything  up 3 flights of stairs. When they finished , I came to pay them and they charged us $1,050!  I was very upset over this! But I paid them anyway. They didn't put things in the right places. I had several boxes they were supposed to put in the garage, but they brought them upstairs, making a lot more work for me.  I called to negotiate the price, but nothing was done. They also did a lot of damage to my brand new furniture, which I didn't discover right away. I did notice that they crushed my $80 dog crate, which they did replace. I also found out that these movers broke the elevator by leaving the door forced open!  I called the office again, but they still wouldn't lower the price, even after learning that their own company broke the elevator!  I strongly advise anyone: DO NOT USE 2 Men and a truck!","7660":"I recently had a 220v outlet installed in my garage by Howard, the price was fair and work was completed without issue . I looks like it was installed when the house was built, Howard also didn't show up on time but early.

My favorite is the Margherita pizza --- deeelish!","5420":"We had a great lunch on the patio today!  Our shrimp po boys sandwiches were very good.  The sweet potato fries and homemade potato chips were tasty too.  We also tried the kale side dish, which was good.  Our server, Kyle provided excellent, friendly service.  The food and wine is reasonably priced, we will be back.","1149":"My wife and I had lunch at Joe's on November 5 2014 while in Las Vegas attending a convention. We were there at 3:10 PM so we decided to have lunch instead of dinner. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fish tacos. The fish served with the fish and chips was horribly over cooked, there were 3 pieces of fish each weighed maybe an ounce each, they were full size pieces, just over cooked so badly that there was nothing left, the chips were just the standard steak fries that are served at about every nickel and dime restaurant across the country, nothing special. At $21.95 I expected something better than this.\nMy wife said the fish tacos were just ok, there were 2 tacos and some broccoli, nothing special, you can get better at Applebee's or Denny's for about $8.00, we paid $17.95 at Joe's. Add in $3.50 each for a couple of iced teas and our bill came to $50.70 less tip.\nBottom line: Joe's might be good for dinner, but if your looking for a good place for lunch, this isn't it.","5393":"This place has some awesome food. Get some sake bombs and that makes everything taste so much better. You also can't beat the service.","4782":"This is the best patio spot for a mild spring sunday. Food was good enough in the neighbourhood as you are enjoying bright daylight in the glasshouse!!!","6500":"We were looking for a lower key brunch restaurant, and this definitely fit the bill! The menu is almost too large but has great choice. Our table shared the Bakers Batch for an appetizer and got main dishes ranging from chicken and waffles to blue crab Benedict to the egg hash. Everything was delicious, but we would all agree that the crab Benedict was the highlight!","8275":"Tandoori Chicken kebab is so delicious! It is spicy but very tolerable. I have had it with rice and without rice, more than enough food to skip the rice though. The salad that it comes with is standard (cucumber, tomato, iceberg, dressing; coleslaw on the side). I ask for more coleslaw usually and they're happy to oblige.\n\nThe hot sauce they give you is unlike any I've had elsewhere, it is more of a salsa but don't let it fool you, it brings the heat! Ask for the white sauce as well (I think it's the salad dressing but I noticed a lot of regulars ask for a side of the white sauce), it helps cool down the spice. \n\nThe Afghan naan is so delicious, I've gone in and had it as a snack before (only .99). Fairly pricey but knock the rice off the menu and my meal is under $10! Not bad.\n\nAs others have said, you will wait approx. 10min for your meal during weekday lunch hour.","7797":"I have been coming to Cartel for the better part of 3 years, living a 5 minute walk or so from the shop. I'm usually here 3 + times per week. They have the best roasts and steeped coffee of any coffee shop I've been to, anywhere, hands down. The coffee is purchased by the owner and roasted in house, and when they run out of a bean, its gone, so if you find a variety you really like stock up as much as possible! The coffee is super fresh and it shows. At any one time they have 5-6 beans available, and you can have them prepared with a variety of methods including pour over and aeropress. \n\nI would say the espresso drinks are good, although not quite as good as the brewed coffee. The espresso by itself tends to be sour and really needs to be paired with milk to take the edge off. \n\nCustomer service has improved over the past 3 years, enough that I have noticed. I think there has been some turnover in staff, where some of departed staff members would straight up ignore customers for several minutes while chatting with friends, the ones I see now are friendly and knowledgeable. When it is busy it can take 20+ minutes to get your drink, especially if you ordered freshly brewed coffee.\n\nThe clientele is hilariously hipster, with flannel, facial hair, and apple computers being almost mandatory, but that doesn't change the quality of the coffee!","1391":"I recently ate at your location. I sat at the bar and was served by Jaclyn...by far one of the most personable individuals I've met. Despite the fact that the restaurant was relatively crowded, Jaclyn made sure that I had what I needed. She made some great recommendations and the drink I had was delicious. I definitely plan on visiting again and have recommended your restaurant to family friends who live in the area. :)","1379":"In Pittsburgh for one night looking for a place near my hotel and found this place.   I was blown away.  I had a local brew with the chicken livers to start,  I've never had chicken livers like this.  They were light and so delicious with out any of the typical liver aftertaste served with a great sauce with a nice spicy kick.   My entre was the wagyu steak, very nicely done.   So much on their menu to explore I will be back.   Reasonable prices too....large appetizer of livers was only $7.","4706":"Amazing. I highly recommend them to anyone visiting Vegas.

He was very pleasant, knowledgeable and a true host.","7371":"I went to Adela's thinking it would be a regular Italian restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised by an excellent dish.\nI could tell that the bread they brought out in the beginning was made right when we were seated. And I forgot what dish I had is called, but it is so well made that it is simple yet very rich. It definitely has clean, home-made taste, but not boring at all. And my stomach felt so clean, satisfied, and comfortable after eating here. This is the best Italian place I've been to in Phoenix.\nI couldn't help but kept wanting to go back to try other dishes, so I ended up having a rehearsal dinner here for my wedding as well. The staff was so helpful and served all of us in a great manner.\nIt is a very great place. I would recommend it to anyone!","2844":"I used to really enjoy eating here until I found out what one of my friends said about this place. He was a former employee of this Jimmy Johns on Power Road and told me about all of the comments that are made behind the counter. Who would've known such a fine establishment could be filled with so much cynicism and racism towards employees. Basically authority will take the nicest employees and then find reasons to take them down verbally with repeated vile comments day in and day out. Nothing like sandwiches made by discriminatory top-level management what taste better than a prejudice filled sandwich I thought sandwiches were made with passion at this place.","7641":"The horchata and Frangelico with the Mexican street corn, chips and salsa were amazing. We tried three tacos - crispy fish, beef and ahi tuna; and a shredded beef burrito - all were tasty! Jessica and Andrew provided out of this world service!

The staff is very pleasant but eventually our dog would come home from daycare or boarding stressed and anxious. Like he wasn't getting all the attention or play he needed. It is not an open room daycare facility the dogs are kept in their kennels and let out for their play sessions. \nHowever the facility has also been very accommodating when we needed. Allowing us to drop our boy off early. Also when he had an accident and needed close medical attention he was able to hang out at the front desk with the staff. \nThe building could use some fixing up\/ cleaning, otherwise charming decor.\nOverall if you have a lower activity dog I think this would be the right place for you.","8887":"Found this spot right around the corner from my house. It was a quick stop for my son's breakfast before school. Didn't have time to review the menu but my son wanted some bacon, eggs and pancakes. We ordered the super breakfast combo which is 3 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage patty, pancakes and hash brown or fruit. We upgraded the pancakes to the banana nut and substituted rice instead of hash browns. Portion size was huge, my son and I shared and took home some of the leftover pancakes. The banana nut pancakes were great, you could taste the bananas and every few bites you got some nuts. For our first visit which was a quick stop we really enjoyed our breakfast and what we paid about $10. Plan to come back to check out more of the menu.","6646":"Had an incredibly tasty salad here the other day.  It was a daily special -- coconut shrimp, mango, raspberries, etc.  Fab food, super setting.  Very nice lunch for the ladies!  Also, beautifully refreshing iced tea.  I'll be back!","2022":"awesome service and helpful knowledgeable staff, love perfume, always buy it here, they have the best return policy too , incase your not happy with anything","1090":"Darrell is great!!\n\nVery friendly and he definitely knows what he is doing!!!\n\nI would recommend Ace's Barbershop!\n\nIn the end of your haircut you still get a back massage!!! Awesome!!!!","4475":"If i could give this pharmacy zero stars I would. The service is completely awful and the workers look like they would rather be somewhere else. And the drive through is the slowest drive through I have been in ever. Also if someone walks up to the counter they stop looking for yours and help the people at the desk. This needs to be fixed immed","7273":"Went here for dinner with my girlfriends and it was delicious!!!! Had some of the best bruschetta I have ever had! Our server was a sweet heart who delivered excellent service! Everything was so relaxing drank some wine it made for a perfect evening! I will def be back!","5564":"My husband & I always love coming here. They have a middle eastern section that is just delish. The seafood is always fresh and so much to choose from, for those of you that like huge crab legs, this is it. The desserts are so yummy. Cotten candy, all different types of cakes, ice cream, puddings! This buffet is top of the line!","5481":"I have been to CETUS twice for oil changes, and it was easy to book the appointments though it took a couple weeks to get in. The service was impeccable and there were no surprises on the bill, no up selling. Just friendly professional service. The waiting area was nice and clean with free WIFI. \nI will be returning here with my wife's RAV4 as it has developed a noise in the exhaust system. Hope to get the same level service.","7447":"Super poor customer service. I had planned with Abel the manager to have his crew come install curbing in my back yard. He only answered his phone the first time I called him. He had re affirmed with me after I asked him 2 times the morning of the installation that they would be arriving mid morning. I got another text from him saying they were running late and would be arriving in the afternoon. I tried calling him various times to see if they were really going to come, and he wouldn't answer the phone. He would respond via text. He then told me his crew got pulled over so they were going to be a little later. I asked if they were really going to come, and he finally responded and said no. But they wanted to reschedule for next week. I already had my sod ordered and my landscaper scheduled to do the sprinklers. \nNot only did he waste my entire day, he was the most unprofessional person I've ever tried to do business with.\n\nDon't waste your time with these guys. Abel is full of $#!+.","7329":"The hubby, myself and our 11 year old decided to try this place out and had a great meal! I had the mushroom Swiss burger and it was seasoned well and was very juicy. Normally I ask for mayo for my burgers to add some moisture, but didn't have to on this burger. My husband had fish and chips with a side of Mac and cheese. Both were very good. The Mac and cheese was nice and cheesy! My daughter had honey BBQ wings and smacked them down. I managed to get a bite of one and they were pretty good. \n\nThe nasty comments about the wait staff by a couple other reviewers was unnecessary...could be toned down a bit, but no need to be mean!\n\nWe will go back again in the future I'm sure!","3318":"Dana is the only person I'll let touch my nails. My gel manicures never chip and it's easy to book!","2898":"I've been seeing Dr. Gorman for years and have been extremely pleased with my care. I willingly drive 45 minutes to her office because she is thorough and balanced, and I always feel at ease. She takes the time to really explain test results and treatment options. As someone who is typically anxious in medical settings, I truly appreciate this. She always listens to my concerns and makes sure we set attainable goals, so I can be proactive with my own health. Everyone in the office is kind and considerate as well, which makes for an all-around positive experience. I highly recommend Revolution Health!","8523":"Dianna is the best!  So friendly and helpful. I have short hair and it's hard to find someone who can cut short hair. We've become friends over time and I always look forward to seeing her knowing that I will be satisfied with the end product. Also, the young ladies who do the shampoos are great. Dianna had Lacey helping her today and we had such a good time visiting. Lacey is a great addition to the salon.","6270":"I have gone in here many times to look around at all the equipment they have at the store. They have anything you need to get started with a new sport or if you are looking to upgrade your gear. I bought a pair of roller hockey pants and pads and they were helpful and knowledgeable. Will be back soon. Thank you!","8303":"I have to say they do have very rude customer service.  Especially the older lady at the front.  But their cakes are great and I can suck up the attitude.","2536":"I ordered assorted party trays for 50 people and they were all delighted!!  The Thai Mango Salad was a huge hit, as was the Lollipop Chicken. We devoured the Hakka Chowmein, Beef with Broccoli, Pad Thai, Mango Delight, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Fried Rice, Vegetable Rolls, Chili Chicken, Thai Red Curry, Deep Fried Tofu and steamed rice. I had some folks with dietary restrictions and they were all easily and deliciously accommodated!  I will absolutely order from them again and cannot recommend them highly enough!","4871":"Ordered through Eat24 for pickup. Service was fast. You ordered just a regular pepperoni and one of their White Truffle pizzas. (I am obsessed with truffle anything, especially fries). I can now say my life is complete because I had this amazing pizza. It is mostly cheese and truffle with a small amount of their red sauce on a nice crispy-on-the-outside-soft-and-airy-on-the-inside crust. You have to try this pizza.","4549":"Great place to start your day. The coffee is good and the staff is welcoming! The decor is travel inspired with a drink selection to match. They serve build your own breakfast sandwiches and have a nice selection of treats. I highly recommend stopping in.","6804":"It was a hot muggy night in old Montreal.  We stroll down the waterfront into this restaurant it was very quiet well air-conditioned the service and crew were incredibly friendly sake was chilled and the Greek salad was to die for.  Oysters very fresh.....I will be back!","3963":"We went for the buffet dinner time. Food was way below average. Service was poor. Ambience bad too. Chicken was not even fully cooked. Halal food though..so that was the only reason we tried it out.","4507":"Noisy beyond belief and apparently designed for high turnover.  Went on a Thursday night at the behest of trendy foodie friends.  The excuse for the noise level -which was off the charts- you literally had to scream to be heard by the person across the table from you- was that two large parties had booked the patio but didn't like the heat so they had to be relocated indoors.  Um...it's Phoenix, people.  In June.  Really? \n\nBoth the banquette and chair seats were less than comfortable even for small, trim people and after the large parties left, the noise level was still very high thanks to concrete floors, high ceilings with inadequate acoustic baffling and vast expanses of bare walls and glass.  I sensed a need for turnover...lots of turnover.\n\nFood was pretty good for Phoenix - nouvelle American but a bit trite.  I've had much better; Cibo comes to mind.  Actually, what I get at home comes to mind.  And my ears aren't ringing for an hour afterward!","1936":"I found Vahn through his website and decided to seek his services. I was very impressed how thorough Vahn was. Very nice person and was able to communicate well. He even went up to the roof to do an inspection and pointed out a lot of things I would have never knew or guessed. After the inspection was over, he was able to provide an extremely detailed report on the same day ! Equally impressive was the fact that even after the inspection, he is available for any questions or concerns that you may have and will have for as long as you own the home - Now who provides such amazing service ????  \n\nI would HIGHLY recommend Vahn, if you want to truly have an amazing home inspection experience.","5263":"It is a nice little house, fell so warm and comfortable dining in. The price is reasonable and good service.\n\nOkonomiyaki- yum yum.\n\nPork Belly Buns- the bun was soft and good, with a piece of fat (barely any meat).\n\nCoconut Curry Grilled Lamb- it was burnt and they still serve to us!!!! I had a bite and had to asked her to take it back.\n\nLychee Red Iced tea- something different to try :) \n\n\nOverall, i would go back and try other foods and drinks on the menu.","2466":"Bad area, noisy guests (migrant workers wedging doors open to smoke and avoid entering thru lobby), free bkfst from 630-930.  I slept in and missed it.","8696":"We checked out Vivo, a semi-new Italian restaurant in Parma this weekend and loved it. It has a cool atmosphere with an open kitchen to watch the action from the large bar. There was a wait but it was worth it! We started at the bar, and decided to stay put even when our table became available, because the bartender Jim took such great care of us! The food was outstanding. We started with Arancini (risotto balls), which were half-priced at happy hour time, and made them an incredible deal. They were delicious, as was the accompanying marinara and pesto drizzle. I had the Gnocchi Rosa (minus the sausage, since I'm vegetarian) and he had the Pistachio Crusted Grouper. Both were very generous portions, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful. By the way, there were plenty of vegetarian options and I'll be back to work my way through them!","2761":"Do not ever go too crab corner...go only to shucks..best oysters for the money...incredible. ....omg and best service","9071":"Sigh, I had high expectations with this going in right in the heart of Strongsville. \n\nPros:\n-No lines\n-Location\n\nCons:\n-Food was cold\n-Extemely expensive, $23 for 2 small bowls and small drinks.\n-Atmosphere is a miss, trying to be chipotle modern but just comes across as bare, empty with an echo.\n-I like indian food, but this tastes more like frozen leftovers from the indian cafeteria style in the mall.\n\nLets just say you don't have to look far if you want more value and fresher food, Chipotle is across the street.","4021":"I grew up eating donuts from here, not even realizing that they are the best. Since leaving Brunswick, I have realized that they really skewed my perception of what a donut should taste like because no others have compared. My favorite was chocolate filled, covered with powder sugar.","6938":"After seeing the reviews here, I'm really surprised, so I had to write my own! I went here for the first time a few weeks ago -  and WOW - sooo much variety!! Especially some of the more rare fruit trees... no way you could find those at Home Depot. Plus, they are grown IN Arizona. We purchased 4 plants - watermelon, 2 bell peppers (1 black, 1 blue), and one more (can't remember... possibly cantaloupe). Planted them when we got home that day, and they're doing fantastic. I'd say about 2.5 times the size as when we got them!! Admittedly, I was a bit worried because they looked almost half dead... maybe that's hence the other reviews, but they truly are doing great. They also have the most awesome playhouses, sheds, barns, even doggie houses (so freaking cute), and lots of garden accessories, like statues and fountains. The thing I loved MOST about this place was how much I learned just talking to one of the guys there! I asked a question about my dying lemon tree, and he gave me TONS of advice!! Extremely knowledgeable and honest... I can't wait to go back. And I WILL go back... I've got my eye on one or two of their fruit trees :D","2856":"I was so impressed with their service and prices that I thought other people should really know about them.  The reason why I said this store has everything is because me, my wife and my son all happened to have found something to buy.  My wife and I were very impressed with the owner's son since he was brutally honest.  We both shared a love for Porsches, so talk to him about that, he has his parked right outside the store, he'll give you a better deal!  Firstly, I bought a new set of Monitor Audio Gold series speakers with a used Mark Levinson amp.  I was very happy to find the GX speakers set and auditioned them since I couldn't find them after Kromer Radio (my favorite electronics store in town) closed.  \n\nA few days later, the owner's son sent us this very original, one of a kind, 90 wide tv stand from India to go with the TV that we have previously brought from Bestbuy a few years ago, and along with a rustic down filled aniline leather sectional sofa.  The console is very unique and the sectional was an amazing price, almost 30% cheaper than Restoration Hardware.  Finally since we were renovating our basement, we really wanted a fireplace but all we saw at the hardware stores were all fake and not unique, they had this very unique Dimplex fireplace that looks just like a fire but it was just electric and with steam replicating a real fire.  Most importantly, the boss (my wife), fell in love with it when she saw it and said yes.  They're definitely quite hidden, so prepare to look for them in the big plaza, I guess my only complaint is that they had a LOT of things to show in which I think they need to move to a bigger location.  But all in all, the price, the selection and the service definitely blew us away.","2312":"Amazing work! \nThe customer service is great nothing bad just that they all do a good job! I enjoy my meals here can't beat it!","6581":"Generous portions, superb caesar salad, relaxing atmosphere, good steaks, and free peanuts! Seriously, what's not to like about this place?  My favorite steak are the T-bone and the prime ribeye, medium well, served with baked yam as the side. \n\nOf course, don't go here if you are allergic to peanuts. it's definitely NOT a free-peanut zone, people throw peanut skins everywhere. And also, it's always a good idea to call ahead. They don't take reservations, but they will usually accomodate you if you say you're on your way and let you know if there is any table open within a certain period of time.","5494":"The Flautas here are so good, have always been fresh, crispy, and generous with toppings (cheese, Guac, sour cream and pico). I'm also a fan of the salsa which is different than any other place I've been. I always get chips at Mexican places and morenos always serves fresh, crisp and lightly salted ones.\nI like that they offer the Moreno's Burrito\n(Stuffed flour tortilla with your choice meat, rice, beans, special salsa, onions, cilantro, cabbage, enchilada style, served with rice & beans) but if you ask for it vegetarian style-no meat, they have made a big deal about omitting it in the past. Need to get some vegetarian options on the menu already!\nwe've been going here for years and the quality has never declined. This place is legit. Totally worth the small inconvenience of finding parking or a table inside. It's a small business and I want them to be successful so I'll continue to go and recommended them :)","9019":"Do NOT buy third party items from Apple.  I purposely purchased my phone case from the Apple Store assuming the quality would be representative of their own products. I spent $99 on a phone case.  When the case fell apart, I tried to return\/exchange it at the Apple store and was told they do not back these items. \n\nSave the $$$ and buy from Amazon.","1107":"This is the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. The house chicken is AMAZING. I also recommend the BBQ baby back ribs. The service is fast and friendly.","4945":"I was very disappointed with my service. I bought a pair of pants and went to another store and tried on the pants with a new shirt. I realized the zipper was broken and went right back to the store to return them. I didn't realize the pants were a final sale item and the girl at the register didn't mention that to me when making my purchase. Maybe 20 minutes went by from the time I purchased them and brought them back. They would not refund my money. I have shopped there many times, but they lost a customer today and will also let my friends and family know about the experience.","7470":"DO NOT GO THERE! Money is their top priority. They will do anything they can to get you to come back in and pay another office visit fee of $50. \nI initially came in for vaccinations and kennel cough medication. After explaining to them that I needed the cheapest route possible because I don't have a lot of money, they advised me that it would be best to wait on the vaccines until she is healed with kennel cough. So, I received the kennel cough medication and came in three weeks later to do the vaccines. After arriving at that appointment to do the vaccines, they advised me that two out of the three vaccines would need a booster in three weeks, something that the doctor didn't tell me last time when i explained I need to cheapest route possible- very shady.\nThat's another office visit fee, and vaccine fee. They neglected to tell I could have done the vaccines at the first initial visit, which would have saved me $100+. \nThis might not be much money for some people, but for me that's huge.","475":"I brought an old chair in to be reupholstered.  This place does BEAUTIFUL work.  HUGE selection of fabrics.  The work on my chair was beautiful, and I wanted to walk out of the store with every single piece there.  I almost bought a custom couch on the spot because it was so comfortable and affordable.  Thank you so much!","1128":"This place is the best for all you seafood lovers. I personally love their garlic sauce non spicy. The lemon pepper mild spicy had the right kick to it, considering I don't eat a lot of spicy food. The calamari was also cooked to perfection. The ambiance was nice and very laid back. Make sure you wear the plastic bib as it can get really messy! The service was also fast and very friendly. Overall the food and experience was excellent.  I highly recommend this place.","3043":"Skip the $1 extra crunchy Bucks batter option, it is just a few small pieces of  potato chips on top the batter. Doesn't taste anything special. Definitely does not worth the $1.","2082":"Best spray tan I've had... The added scents are such a nice touch.  Its great not to smell like spray tan for the rest of the evening!  She also powders areas that might get sweaty to keep you tan looking even before you head into the hot sun.  Looking forward to my next tan!","2116":"The food was the only good thing. We waited for 15 minutes before we were acknowledged, and it wasn't busy. The service was terrible - we were constantly repeating our drink orders because she would forget, or she would be annoyed because we interrupted her flirting.","2057":"san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice.","6934":"I was referred to Dr Hobgood by my allergist. Within seconds of consulting with him, I knew he was the right doctor to perform my septoplasty. Dr Hobgood is not only incredibly personable, but he also does an amazing job! My surgery was quick, pleasant, and painless... All words that I couldn't imagine using to describe a surgery, but it's true. Although recovery lasted about 7-14 days, I wasn't in any pain throughout the process and I would describe it as extremely mild.  Dr Hobgood's pre and post op paperwork was clear and the surgery center was perfect. Even on days when I was early to Dr Hobgood's office, I never had a wait. Last but not least, I am so happy with my results! I would recommend Dr Hobgood to anyone!","1507":"Best pizza I've had in years!!! The dough is homemade, perfectly thin and the food was at our table 10 minutes after we ordered. Thumbs up!","1271":"New owners here as many have already mentioned.  This place was one of two restaurants that opened here on Spadina in the mid 70s.  At that time, Chinatown was on Dundas congregated around Elizabeth.  I went often back in the day.  I returned a few times over the last 3 years.  I won't be going again after I finish this review.\n\nThe cooked food - the quality is VERY uneven.  \n\nThe BBQ food - the stuff hanging in the front windows - BEWARE - if it didn't sell today, it'll be hanging back up there tomorrow.  I'm surprised no one has died from this yet.  They are not the only ones that do this.  New Hong Fatt also does it.  Other BBQ restaurants such as Kings Noodles and House of Gourmet do not.\n\nThe unventilated basement bathroom has headroom of about 5 feet.\n\nThe place is dirtier than any place I've seen and that includes the worst sidewalk eateries in Kowloon.","705":"The restaurant staff are really friendly. Here for the first time the restaurant is nice and very spacious. Ordered the Tan Tan Men very delicious.","2042":"I bought a used iPhone and was using it for t-mobile... well when i updated it it reset the whole phone. so i tossed it over to sam and with in a few hrs he had it all updated and unlocked again for t-mobile... thanks Sam!","7542":"My husband and I absolutely love 4 Sons Garage Door. They are extremely knowledgeable in what they do and you never have to worry about he quality of their service. They're kind, honest, and reliable. I highly recommend them if you're having issues with your garage. I won't use anyone else ever. Thank you guys for all you've done!","2800":"Nak Won!!\nFood was not the best. I ordered bulgogi and it was super dry. Service on the other hand was TERRIBLE!! I have to press the service button 9262515391836 times to get their attention. They aren't really friendly either. The only thing that may have been decent were the cold appetizer dishes you get at the beginning. I rather go next door and eat at Minerva Owl!","4155":"Total dive... not a single pretty dancer in the joint!   Don't waste $$$ on overpriced admission.","7359":"Ship your stuff any other way you can, you will be frustrated with the service from the drivers and the non existent customer service. what a joke","6339":"Fantastic Blueberry London Fog! Tasty without being overwhelming - a perfect combination for a rainy day. Great service as well.","6111":"Really, really, good.  There are so many brunch options to choose from, I had trouble deciding.    My friend and I ended up splitting the apple fritters to start, then we both had the tofu benny.  The hollandaise was a tiny bit on the salty side, but still very tasty.  Loved the kale salad that came as a side.  The coffees were large, dark, and delicious, as all coffee should be.    The service was fantastic.   I will definitely return, I need to try the red velvet pancakes (what?!).","4417":"Annie, the owner of the salon portion, is ABSOLUTELY...THE BEST! She really knows her stuff about hair and is a color correction specialist. Before I moved out to Arizona (originally grew up in NY), my hair was bleach blonde and I never liked it. My hair dresser back in NY LOVED blonde and so kept making my hair lighter with each visit. I did not have the heart to yell at her and say stop coloring my hair the color YOU want it to be. When I met Annie, the experience was ENTIRELY different!!! The first thing she asked me was what I envisioned for my hair color, what I did not like about it, and how I thought it would be perfect. Another thing she said was that anytime I was bored with my hair to feel free to tell her and she would revolutionize it again. She stayed true to her promise in the now two years that I have been seeing her. I also LOVE that if I want something new done to my hair and it is not fashion forward, she will work with the idea until it is. It always comes out even better than the original thought!!! I keep telling her that she needs to start her own product line too so hopefully that is to come soon!!! :D\n\nAs far as the vintage portion...Miles runs that. It always has intriguing items that are not what you would expect to find just anywhere. I have personally not made a purchase yet, but my colleague and I went to 3rd Thursday and she bought a door for $5!!! There is not even where to have lunch for that price! Miles gave her helpful suggestions as to how to recreate the door into a unique piece of art with either using pictures and turning it into a giant frame or using it as a room divider. Pretty cool!!! I am excited to see what my first purchased item will be someday! \n\nAnnie and Miles are an unstoppable team! Go visit!","4665":"Erin exceeded my expectations.  She listened to what I wanted, took her time, and and gave me a great haircut (long layers and face-framing layers).  Always love the aveda scalp massage as well.  What a pleasant and relaxing experience!","9074":"I've been to many walgreens before but this one by far is the worst pharmacy wise. They are super rude and are not compassionate at all. My husband had just had hand surgery and was in extreme pain and rather than putting it as an immediate they made us wait 50 minutes. A few weeks later he had teeth pulled ( not his best month) and again it was 50 minutes. They claimed they were busy yet as I waited no one came to the desk or drive thru. They found it more important to talk about planning the pharmacists husband's birthday party. I understand that there were others in front of us however when someone is in extreme pain I would prioritize.  Overall I am very disappointed in this walgreens pharmacy. I will now drive 20 minutes out of my way to another location where the customer service actually exists.","7468":"OMG! The desserts looked amazing (that's why I gave it one star). I ordered $75 worth of cakes, pastries, tarts, etc. to bring to a party. Oh boy, was I ever embarrassed when we all bit into the cake. It was like cardboard...no flavor, not moist. SO SO DISAPPOINTING. It didn't get better with the rest of the items purchased. Stay clear of the bakery!","3571":"This has to be the best car wash service in Vegas. I've been all over for a good car wash and once I found Alamo I was locked in. Everyone there is extremely thorough in their work and it really shows. The price is also hard to beat as well. I've paid more in the past for a lesser wash so I have no complaints on that point. The only downside, if I had to pick one, would be the wait time; on average, I am there for an hour and a half each time I get the wash but I would say it is well worth it since they take their time to make sure you leave with a brand new looking ride. I love my WRB Subaru WRX and these guys make it look so pretty every time I'm there :)","5587":"CONTINUED FROM PREVIOUS...When I arrive, the door is locked, AGAIN.  I call and knock with no response.  Finally, the guys at Interlocks show up and let me in.  The guy that is at the front desk is the guy that has been answering the phone but he is not the same guy that does the repairs.  He doesn't even acknowledge me.  Jake is actually THERE this time and he 'happily' reports to me that I won't lose the $150 I have already invested in the phone repair and if I bring it back to them, they will replace the LCD completely for another $200.   I pay them $110 to get my phone back with NO LCD screen at all.  I have no idea if it is even the same phone I dropped off to them almost 2-weeks before but I decide I am never coming back, I don't care to work with them again.  I am completely burnt out on this experience and I am just happy to be done with this company and their horrible communication so I take my phone home, in its unusable state and vow to never even THINK about iSolutions ever again.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of this saga.  I FINALLY save up $300 to get my LCD screen replaced at another, more highly recommended business on Yelp.  I am so excited!!!  Finally, I will get my phone back after months of brewing in anger.\nI drop it off at my new repair shop and they have the part in stock and they will have it done in AN HOUR!\nThe hour passes and I return to my new repair shop but my problems continue with iSolutions.  My new repair shop asks me upon return, if I was sure this was a t Mobile phone.  I was most definitely sure!  He reports to me that whoever opened the phone last must have removed the original t Mobile charging port and replaced it with an AT&T charging port then because not only was the part removed and replaced with one of a different service provider but there were several screws missing and now the menu button on the screen is inoperable\/dead.  IN my mind, iSolutions probably had a customer that needed an S7 Edge charging port and, being the sneaky 'opportunists' they are, they removed my charging port and were planning to 'fix' their little cover up when I coughed up the other $200 that I would be paying to have them replace my LCD screen again.  Keep in mind, this is just my speculation based on my experience with iSolutions so far.\nLuckily, for me, my new repair shop worked with me to replace the charging port, the LCD screen and troubleshoot the problems with the cellular band being disrupted since iSolutions removed the charging port.  Finally, I have my phone back.  I hope someone saves themselves some heartache by not working with iSolutions, if they are on the fence about it and that they find a local shop with a good reputation.  I can't wait to hear the reasons they come up with, as to why it was okay that they stole parts out of my phone.  I have seen their responses to other bad reviews and I can see that they try to make it appear to be the customer's fault and they do not seem to have any accountability for running a business poorly and in bad faith.","993":"This place was TERRIBLE!!!!! They did not serve us because they did not have clean dishes. I have NEVER heard of that in my life. Denny's is TERIIBLE!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!  If I could give ZERO STARS, I would!!!!","4510":"Was in the area doing some shopping and saw this place featured on a local TV program. I wanted to stop by for lunch but they weren't open until 4pm. Ended up eating elsewhere and coming back to get some takeout b\/c I really wanted to give this place a try.\n\nTried their Sampler menu option to get a taste of everything. Wings were great. Ribs tasted good, albiet a little dry. Beef Brisket Sandwich was pretty good but I had better Pulled Pork Sandwich elsewhere just across the street. Now the Fries - they were absolutely horrid beyond belief! Looked burnt and did not taste fresh - as if they refired some leftover fries from the previous night. \n\nFood portions were not as big as portrayed on TV.\n\nOverall, I would not come back even if I were in the area again. So many other places I rather try instead.","8474":"Last week we purchased tickets through Fandango to see Star Wars at Regal Red Rock IMAX.  We had assigned seats and everything was wonderful.  Last night we again purchased tickets through Fandango to see Hateful 8 at AMC Town Square (another sold out show).  When we arrived we were told we were not allowed in the building and had to wait in an outdoor line (it was 42 degrees and very windy).  I asked to use the restroom and was told I had to walk back down the  cathedral style stairs and use a restroom at a neighboring establishment.  My husband asked if they could make an exception for a pregnant woman and we were told we would have to speak with guest services, but there was already another angry customer ahead of us in that line.  I ended up taking the stairs.\n\nAfter we were finally allowed in the building we found the theater comfortable.  The 3+ hour movie had an intermission and when my husband went to use the restroom he was told the one nearest the theater was closed and he had to go out into the lobby.\n\nThe one star is for the comfortable seats with ample leg room. I considered a second star for the availability of alcoholic beverages, but being pregnant I would have preferred easy access to a restroom (and I'm pretty sure the drinkers would appreciate that too).\n\nI am not sure if the outdoor line was a crowd control or security technique, but it didn't make me feel safe.  The crowd was not at all unruly, yet the actions and demeanor of the staff made me feel I was being punished or regulated.  I will be patronizing Regal cinemas in the future for a much more customer friendly experience.","3576":"I am really surprised by the negative reviews.  This place is awesome!!  We have been here twice now and both times were equally great.  As a fried pickle connoisseur, I can say that these are some of the best I have had and the Loaded Fries with chili and cheese are the stuff dreams are made of.  The burgers have been perfectly cooked both times as well and the topping choices are terrific!  The service is on point and the atmosphere is fun.  A definite new favorite!","8746":"Great place, I love it when the sushi chefs have kung-fu movies on.","5630":"This Life Time location has everything a family could want.  Great kids facilities, rock wall, indoor and outdoor pools, and a variety of classes.  The gym is always clean and well-managed.  Talk to Yassna - she will set you up with a membership that works for you.  She's awesome.  Great club!","8770":"So impressed with this place. Dinner was so good the first visit that my husband and I came back the next morning for breakfast. Visited again recently, and everything was perfect from the food to the service. It's not often you find restaurants like this one, highly HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! :)","3869":"This place is so awesome and authentic.  The food is great and the staff are all so friendly.  Great experience.  For parents with kids, they also have a family change room, which was helpful.","3741":"Kevin showed up when you said he was he was very professional and efficient all in all very happy with the service I got","8065":"Our table came here for the second time, for dinner on a Saturday night with a groupon. The waitress was pleasant and had lots of tips for us, the beer selection is varied and changes all the time, and the non-beer options are even really good.\n\nThe first time I came here I got the steak burger also, and since it was so good, I got it again. Ordered medium, it came out somewhere between medium and medium rare, very juicy and very flavorful. I'm not a fan of carbs so I did bunless, which they were able to successfully pull off.  The bacon jam is amazing, and really makes the burger.  We got a total of 3 steak burgers and 1 normal burger as well as salmon.  All options were really great.\n\nSalad comes with an amazing basil dressing, I dumped it all on the salad and didn't regret a thing.  We also had some truffle fries, and they are pretty dang good too.  My mother didn't like them because she doesn't like flavors, but the rest of us thought the truffle and Parmesan were great touches.\n\nIf I had one complaint, $15 for a burger and fries is probably too spendy, even if it is good food. This place isn't going to shake the fact it is a brewpub.\n\nThey leave all the doors and windows and garage doors and whatever else open, so it's pretty freezing in there at night, bring a coat in the winter.","8191":"Fry's Electronics is a place I go to in emergencies.  Unfortunately, when something breaks on my computer, it usually takes the whole thing down.  Forget about finding something at a decent price on Egghead and having it there in a couple days; no access to the internet means a trip to Fry's.\n\nAnd a trip to Fry's means finding out that they have everything - except the replacement part you need.  You see, that part, which you installed a year before, is now obsolete, and they don't sell it.  Never mind that millions of people are still using it because most of us can't afford to have bleeding edge technology and upgrade over every miniscule increase in speed or graphic ability, and that you can get it easily from an online store - to Fry's, it's obsolete.  The reason it's obsolete?  Because it's cheaper than the new item that they want you to buy.  The new item that requires buying three or four more new items along with it since your old equipment is not compatible with the new.  In this day and age, no computer means a third to a half of your communication with the outside world, and not to mention access to important parts of your life, is gone.  You're stuck watching as a $50.00 replacement spirals into the $500.00 range.\n\nOne thing that Fry's teaches you is preventative maintenance.  You learn to make sure you've got some money and that Egghead or Amazon has what you need in store the first time you even hear the slightest rattle or see the slightest flicker.  If not, it's back to Fry's - Virgil greets you at the door, you descend through the rings until, under the beating wings of the Beast himself, you gather everything you need and slowly wind your way through their service line and back to the Purgatory of their parking lot.  And Virgil's tried to sell you a bunch of candy on the way out as well.","3781":"Worst electric system. IPod hookups dont work and the speakers were blown. Butlers go through your shit and the lamps never turn off.","7663":"Average food that is expensive. Go here if nicely cut up under ripe fruit is what you crave. Terrible value for your money and the fact that there is line ups every weekend makes no sense at all. Go to Fran's down the street for better bang for your buck.\n\nService is good doe","4848":"I'm a hairstylist that relocated from Boston to Vegas about two years ago. I did my hair myself when I moved here because I didn't trust anyone to do my hair. It's super thick, coarse in texture, and stylist tend to panic when I sit in their chair. I found Ellice on Instagram and saw her work. I decided to give her a try because her portfolio was beautiful, she has years of experience, we talked shop and I could tell she knew how to color hair properly, and her prices weren't outrageous like most places in Vegas. \nI've seen her ever since then. I get more compliments on my hair than I ever have before. I work in a gym now and have sent her 2-3 clients that absolutely LOVE her! Ellice is professional, talented, and so sweet. She will give you the look you're envisioning while keeping your hairs integrity intact. I won't let anyone else touch my hair, not even myself anymore!! It's her hair now, she's stuck with me!! :)","7771":"Awesome food... hospitality was great ... \n\nFantastic lunch buffet and reasonable price \n\nfinally ....

The staff was unprofessional and had no idea what they were doing.  The masseuse was polite but was not quite sure how to give a massage.   There was no manager or person in charge and the staff is not even sure how the pricing works.    I was terribly disappointed and feel like I wasted my money.  If you are considering a massage here I would recommend that you reconsider and go elsewhere.   This place is a joke","456":"I received your automated email today checking on my purchase and even asking to refer a friend.  \n\nI am sorry but I can not and will not be referring anyone to you in the future.  While the product I purchased is fine, the customer service I received was not.  Ordering glasses on April 1st and being able to get them until April 30th is completely too long of a wait time.  On top of that I had to contact you twice for updates (2 weeks and just over 3 weeks) on when they might be available.  No one contacted me with any updates.  Even when I came to get my glasses, not one word was spoken to me about the wait\/delay I had.  I barely even got a Thank You from the man who fitted me that last day.  For what I paid (along with insurance) for the product, you failed on a service level.\n\n\nI hope you can improve your service for any future customers.  It probably will not be me in the future as I will look for another place to do business with in a couple years.\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Erickson\n\nP.S.

I clicked the link in the email and that address was rejected twice. \n\nelvfrontdesk@cvec.us  -  does not work","1871":"I keep giving this place a chance, and will continue to do so. \n\nFirst- the pizza. It is great which is why I keep going back. It would get 4 stars but for what follows. \n\nThe service is the problem for me- I have been there frequently for 45 minutes watching tables (like 3)that arrive after us get served and leave before our pizza arrives. It seems like they staff one hard working, competent server AND one poor server per shift. Or the kitchen is just disorganized?\n\nAt other times I'm the guy getting my food and leaving in a reasonable time. \n\nIf it were consistently slow, I would only go when in the mood for a leisurely date night and be perfectly happy.  But with my luck, that would be the night everything arrives in 15 minutes and there is a huge line out the door with pressure from the server to pay my bill.","6772":"I'm writing this review as I sit in Lola, sipping on a cappuccino, so you know they have free WIFI.  This review isn't about the WIFI. You also know they have coffee, since Coffee is in their name, and it's a caf\u00e9.  This review isn't about that either.\n\nThis is about the quiche.\n\nActually, it's about all the pastries, since they're all made by the same unfathomably talented pastry chef, but it's the quiche that, every time I have it, makes me wonder, If this is quiche, what's that stuff I ate every other time I ordered quiche?  It's light. Just ... just so, so light, and fluffy. The crust is crispy and light and buttery. And it costs far less than inferior quiche at other places (about $4, I think).\n\nBut the five stars I gave it aren't just for the quiche, or the rest of the amazing pastries.  This place just does everything right: the location is in a beautiful, historic location; they have a terrific selection of loose-leaf tea; the atmosphere is cool, with worn concrete floors, a high ceiling, and vintage furniture; the staff is friendly, and acts like a family; and a vintage Bang & Olufsen stereo playing music that is far too cool for me to identify it.  Oh, and the coffee is great.","2458":"Best fish and chips in town! Clean restaurant with great customer service. The fish was fresh and well seasoned.","9085":"If I was able to give less than one star I would. I worked with Anna from Powerhouse Platinum and I end up paying for everything. First of all they gave me a house full of bugs spider webs and scorpions. Everything in that house was dirty. I wish I could upload my video from how they gave me the house. When I left the house I brought cleaning crews, carpet cleaner I changed the air conditioning filters dreamed the grass. She never returned my security deposit and she is also charging me $350 extra because the walls are dirty. I lived there almost for 3 years. Its called natural wear and tear. I hate them. I was so nice to give them the house in a better condition that they gave me. I will  never do business with them EVER...","4755":"Walleye sandwich + Czechvar for the win.

Sears checked my alignment which looked great and rebalanced the tires, but informed me 3 of 4 rims were bent. Through Internet searches I found Quest Rim and decided to give them a try. Tommy, the owner, was very responsive to my needs and did excellent work. I know this because unfortunately after the work was done I still felt a slight vibration. NOTE: It was not the rims, keep reading! I brought my car to my dealership (Classic Hyundai- Mentor) as I was wondering if it was a possible suspension issue. I told them about Sears and Quest and prior to checking my suspension they were immediately suspicious of the job that may have been done on my rims. Most places, to their knowledge, does a very poor job straightening rims. So much in fact they won't even use a straightening service and only replace bent rims. Second guessing my decision, I asked them to test the rims that had been worked on. They unmounted the tires and put my rims on their state of the art balancing machine that can diagnose if rims are within factory specification. To their surprise the rims passed the test and out of all the measurements, the largest deviation from perfect was .014. Most of the measurements were within .007 of spec. Essentially, the rims are as straight as they are from the factory. The ride has gotten smoother and although I can still feel some vibration, I know one thing is certain, it is not from bent rims as they are perfectly straight! I'll have to look into my suspension but, this saved me so much time and money. Replacing my rims would have cost upwards of $250 p\/rim not to mention charges for mounting, balancing and install. Excellent Service. Excellent Quality. Excellent Price. Highly recommended! Thanks again Tommy!!! Ohh and by the way, I contacted Tommy though his website's contact us e-mail page. He got back to me immediately the next morning and they were done the same day.","125":"Went to wash my car on the weekend. Middle bay was closed because the owner was cleaning it. Went into a bay with a vehicle already there. I've already started cleaning my car and it have a foaming soap all over. Then the vehicle at front of me left after couple minutes. The owner told me to go forward, I've told him it is inconvenient for me to do it. I forwarded it anyway just not to cause any trouble. He came back and talked to me again, and asked me why it is inconvenient for me, I told him there were a car at front me when I started and there's a lot of soap already and I don't want the soap to go inside my car. He said another customer can come and might not have a space. It wasn't even busy that time, we were only 2 cars out of 6 spaces. Owner is rude and no love for his customers. Never coming back again. 1 dollar won't last that long find another car wash if you want save your money.","3825":"Had a Groupon deal for it and all I can say is, ONE OF THE BEST TIMES OF MY LIFE!!!\n\nThe tour took us through the Red Rock Canyon and the sceneries were breathtaking! We went in January so it was 30 degrees out and when we rolled through the valley of the canyon the temperature dipped to 20-25 degrees. It was very chilly. \n\nThe 2 tour guides were AWESOME. They emphasized safety first. The scooter-cars are very easy to handle and after a few minutes of riding, you'll feel like a pro at it.\n\nDo not leave Las Vegas without checking out Scoot City!!! You will not be disappointed!","7558":"Sokolowski's University Inn epitomizes the reason so many Mid-westerners are fat.  I'm not sure this place could exist in my home-state of California, but I'm sure glad it's here in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to the sign outside, Sokolowski's was established in 1923, but I didn't find it until 2008.  We went here with a group of about 15 grad students from Case Western, and all of us were newbies to this purveyor of Polish fare.  As we entered, we were a little surprised to find that they serve food cafeteria-style.  This was a little disappointing at first, because we had come here in the hopes of having a semi-fancy meal, before heading off to a gala.  However, the Slavic victuals soon put any disappointment out of my head.\n\nThe menu is hand written daily and photo copied on a few dozen pieces of paper that are strewn throughout the restaurant for you to peruse as you move toward the serving area, where you'll get your oversized cafeteria tray and utensils.  Over the course of nearly a dozen dinner-time visits, I have found that you often have to endure a queue that snakes through one of the dining rooms, through the bar and finally to the serving area, with its stainless steel steam trays and chilled desserts.\n\nThe entree offerings change fairly regularly, but there are a few staples it seems, including Polish staples like kielbasa and stuffed cabbage - As one who eschews meat of the porcine variety, I haven't tried a the sausages, but the stuffed cabbage is rather tasty with a tangy tomato sauce, very similar to the one made by my own Jewish grandmother. I have tried a hand full of different dishes there, including Wienerschnitzel, Chicken Paprikash, Prime Rib, Rib Eye Steak, Fried Perch, and a few others.  I always found them quite tasty, but the atmosphere adds to the experience to make the food even more pleasurable than it would be on its own, say if you were to eat the same thing at home.  The walls are a collection of Cleveland and Sokolowski family memorabilia, and the two often overlap.  There are old newspaper clippings and photos, signs and posters, and other assorted stuff that you wouldn't ever think to put on the walls of your own eatery, but here they seem perfectly in order.\n\nMy absolute favorite item there, by far, however, is one of their staple side dishes ... the pierogi.  You will see this repeated by many of my peers throughout the many reviews of Sokolowski's, and deservedly so.  They let you choose two sides with your entree, and more often than not, I get pierogi for both. Every great eatery - from those with Michelin stars to those that serve from a street cart - has to have something that sets them apart, and for Sokolowski's it's the pierogi. They are delicious, tender potato filled pasta that are smothered in sauteed onions and butter.  They are no friend to your arteries, but with each bite they give your tongue a little hug that makes it nearly impossible not to smile like a besotted middle-schooler as you eat them.\n\nThey have other side dishes too, including noodles with cabbage, mashed potatoes, vegetables and others I barely notice.  There's also a salad bar that is included with your meal.  It has rudimentary salad fixings, including a large bowl of chopped lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, etc.  But what I like best about the it is the selection of Eastern European salads, including thick potato salad, macaroni salad, cucumbers with dill and sour cream, and the pickled beets.  You could make a meal of these and a side of pierogi, and still your arteries would howl with indignance ... I'd still ignore their screams, because it's just that tasty.\n\nWhy only four stars when I like this place so much?  There are a few aspects that detract from the experience: the queuing up & waiting is not the most entertaining way to spend your pre-meal time. Another biggie is their hours of operation.  They aren't open for dinner on weekdays, and on weekends, they close at 9p, which means a dinnertime craving of pierogi on a Wednesday evening must go unmet.\n\nNevertheless, this place wouldn't have been around for almost 90 years if there wasn't something special about it.  Go, eat and enjoy!","6345":"My original quote and deposit on a 12' x 12' tile job were made on 12\/6\/16.  The job was completed 3\/ 9\/17.  During the 3 month process I had delays due to incompetent ordering\/install\/communication and follow-up.  The staff (install and office) are, for the most part, very nice people.  They consistently apologized for the problems and gave me an $88 discount.   I would have preferred that more effort went into the actual work.  I have more projects that I need done and will definitely not be using Las Vegas Flooring.","63":"This is by far the best Shwarma I had ever had! Service with a smile, tasty, and late hours. I would highly recommend for everyone to have it","8744":"Best Indian, best takeout I've had in years.  Staff was great to work with and had excellent suggestions.\n\nThe Fish Pakora was sublime. Perfectly fried and tender on the inside.  Lamb Madras was amazing as well.

Clearly there is someone in the kitchen who knows South Indian cuisine, as well.","6977":"horrible experience ! This restaurant makes us feel like they are dishonest. One waitress appears very very sneaky.  This was our third visit and our waitress was very rude. she talked to us with disrespect and treated us like crap,! we just sat down and wanted to have a peaceful dinner. then when she handed us our bill which  we found out that the waitress added a few dollars tip without informing the us.  She wrote the amount on our bill! this place is very dishonest. Hiw can they write their own tip onto customer bills without telling the,? we are never going back there again. if you want to risk going there, make sure you check the bill for every item....do not be fooled!","5454":"This is one of the places I go to if I'm craving pasta. Absolutely one one of the best places I've been for great pasta. I ordered the vongole and asked for garlic and oil sauce as I'm not a big fan of any tomato sauce. Friends tried pizza and it was awesome. All six of us at our table loved whatever we had ordered. Only complaint would be that we were tightly seated. We were six at a small table table and we basically had to choreograph our fork movements. We couldn't lean back. If we had to go to the bathroom, we all had to get up. For this reason I would give it a four. It's my only complaint.","1760":"I can't recommend this place enough. Hands down the most 'authentic' Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area wiith mouth watering dishes that really make you question what you've been eating from all those other places this whole time. \n\nOne bone to pick, where I was staying was just outside their 3 mile delivery area so had to pick up. Also, particularly during the holidays, business is high, and they are short staffed so you might have to wait for front of house to get to you while taking phone orders, seating guests and cashing delivery orders. I highly recommend calling first and then picking it up. \n\nBut, aside from that unpleasantness, their food is exemplary, (orange chicken,  crispy duck and chicken dumplings are divine) and I can't wait to come back.","6812":"5.99 plus tax in less than 5 mins. Needed pictures for my international visas. They were very professional and knowledgeable since different countries need different sized pictures. Would recommend them.","5306":"I have heard good things about this latest trendy breakfast restaurant so I decided to try it.  Unfortunately the entire experience was very disappointing.  I ordered the short stack of blueberry pancakes, 3 strips of bacon, and a glass of orange juice.  The total price was $14.95 before leaving any tip (which seemed very pricey even if the food wood have been incredibly good).  Unfortunately the food was very mediocre at best.  The place was not crowded and I was the only person in line to order food.  There were plenty of empty tables as well.  It took well over 20 minutes for my food to show up and it was not warm (not sure why it would have taken so long- no real reason) The pancakes were also  very dry (not fluffy, but flat and hard) and had only  5 blueberries scattered across all three tiny pancakes (when I ordered I was lead to believe the short stack pancakes would be very large, in reality they were each smaller than my first in circumference.  They did mention they were low on blueberries when they delivered my food and decided to substitute non-ripe\/hard greenish strawberries instead and asked me of I hoped that was okay.  It would have been nice to have been told that before I ordered.  I didn't really have a choice since I didn't have time to wait for them to make me something else.  The bacon was actually good and the fresh squeezed juice was okay as well (I've had way better though - this was clearly a little watered down).  The meal didn't come with enough syrup either and nobody ever came around to offer more syrup or ask how everything was.  I personally love breakfast and am willing to pay for quality and good service.  Unfortunately my experience had neither of those.","7205":"Kudos to The Cupcake Shoppe for great marketing. They seem to have a little bit of a cult following but I've always found that their cupcakes were lacking a little something.\n\nWhen you need to  fulfill the cupcake craving they do the job, when you need something to impress they definitely look pretty, but I've always found their cupcakes to be on the dry side. \n\nAt almost $3.00 a cupcake there's definitely better out there.","7279":"You ever want to eat and drink in church now is your chance.  Friendly attentive staff superior food at reasonable prices. Clean...... My new favorite place and they also have live music this is a true gem in the city.","5053":"My BLT on a pumpernickel bagel was heaven. It was steaming hot right from the panini press, with perfectly crisped bacon and fresh, juicy tomato. Coffee was sublime, as well.

Can't wait to try the fritters.","5766":"I wish we'd read these reviews before we dropped off our lamp. He's held it hostage a month now, after telling us the job would take a week - no explanations. I haven't much optimism he's going to fix it or that he's even looked at it. I guess we'll go rescue it and consider the $10 deposit the ransom. What a waste of time and money. :(","5664":"Horrible food & even worse service.  Go buy a $2 bottle of Ragu and a box of pasta. Guaranteed that will be a better meal that what is served at Alessia's!  Bread was burned and sauce tasted like cold tomato soup!!! Disgusting!!! WARNING: DO NOT VISIT!!!!","8871":"This place is CASH ONLY!\n\nIf you find yourself in sin city... do not miss an opportunity to try the roast pork - it is delicioso.  The roast pork is listed on the menu as Roasted Belly Pork.  We have tried roast pork at plenty of restaurants in Monterey Park, SF Chinatown, Cupertino, Hong Kong, Vancouver Chinatown, etc... and this place has one of the best chanchito around!  We ordered won ton with noodles soup and the noodles were not overcooked and Hong Kong style.  Soup broth was just okay.  Also had a Yang Chow Fried Rice that was a bit on the greasy side, but acceptable if you are hungry.  We will definitely come back for the roast pork on our next visit to Las Vegas.","8973":"Wow!  What a happy hour!  The food here is incredible and during happy hour all the small plates are only $5 each!  This gave us an opportunity, over a few visits, to try almost everything on the small plate menu.  The first time we were there, we ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the steak skewers and the brie mushroom toast.  For two people this was a meal in itself!  We were full by the end.  \n\nThe bacon wrapped scallops, the tenderloin toast and the oysters were ordered on the next trip.  Thinking this couldn't nearly be enough food, we ordered the chicken tacos too.  The oysters Rokerij were incredible!  I'm not a big fan of oysters - in fact, can't eat them unless they are covered with lots of gooey stuff.  These were a step above Rockefeller!  The bacon-wrapped scallops and the shrimp both are served with three different sauces on the plate.  It would be best if you tried all three.  My favorite is the spicy red sauce.  They are all very good and everything tastes better with bacon!  The chicken tacos were not my favorite.  There was a funky taste to them that I can't pinpoint.  I'm not against trying them again...\n\nThe bartenders are great!  Can't beat the service here (at least in the downstairs bar).\n\nHappy Hour is only from 3pm to 6pm, which makes it hard to get there after working until 5pm, and prices are only good if you are sitting at one of the bars (there is one upstairs and one downstairs).  The bartenders upstairs are attentive and for the most part friendly but not nearly as good as the bartenders downstairs.  They make you feel at home and will do everything to try to accommodate you and your party.  The new Richardson's is opening soon next door and we are looking forward to trying that.  But our heart is with Rokerij.","5369":"Huge fan of the breakfast at Main Dish, it is a common Sunday destination. breakfast is tasty and they have a good assortment of choices.

I'll be trying to earn that 11th free ice cream!","4539":"Usually I don't put much weight into other's reviews that knock the service at any establishment. Usually my own experience differs vastly from those who knock the service so nonetheless I decided to give this place a chance since it's down the street from my house. Went there 2 weeks ago with 3 other people and we had to seat ourselves. After seating ourselves in a very visible booth directly in front of the sushi bar, we had to wait over 30 minutes for the staff to greet us and take our drink orders. Not exactly good service. The food was good and I chalked it up to a bad night for the wait staff. \n\nWith the food being pretty good, my favorite place to get authentic cold noodles, so I figured I'd try it again the following week... BIG mistake! We were seated this time upon arrival, but that was the only positive. Again we waited 40 minutes for anyone to even make eye contact let alone take our drink orders. Keep in mind both times I've went there it was only half full at best, so in no way was the staff too busy to notice. Throughout the entire evening.. And I mean 2.5 hours!!! We had to tell the waitress what we wanted and if we wanted more water, sake, sushi, dessert, etc. Not once did she ask us for anything! By the way, don't even try to exchange your Yelp voucher.. She looked like she'd never seen it before and only took $10 off.. Which is what I paid.. And me trying to explain to her that it should be $20 off added about 20 minutes to already the longest trip to a sushi bar that I've ever had. Food-wise I'd give this joint a 4, the food isn't the issue. But the service is an absolute joke and I'll never go back. This is the only place that I've experienced service so bad that I'd never go back! Besides, Hiro Sushi is right down the street and the service is 1000x better!  Sorry for the long review, but I guarantee I just saved you some time and the longest, most ridiculous sushi experience you've ever had if you were thinking of trying this place out!","8950":"We had a small catered going away event for a co-worker.  We were provided exceptional service from Shay, Espy and Becky.  Thank you!","982":"Helen's was terrible.  I got magic straight at Helens I think I paid $150 ish and she did not know what she was doing.  & kept blaming me, and kind of made me feel stupid my korean was not on par with hers.  \n\nThen when I called to tell her it didn't come out she had me come in again.  Attempted it again but given she doesn't know what she's doing obviously it didn't come out.  \n\nShe also laughed when I asked her to cut my white husband's hair.  Told me to go to a white salon.  I thought she was really rude.  Hair city is waaaaay better.  623) 847-0308\n\nHair city has on multiple occasions successfully straightened my hair (hair city did give me a funky hair cut once)","2932":"So, so, so delicious and just as friendly.  We ordered dumplings, pork buns, Peking duck and a noodle dish, incredible!!","492":"I'm so glad we decided to take a chance on the negatively rated restaurant. \nWe had the pasta tasting menu with the wine pairing, yes, there were dishes that we liked better than others, they were all cooked perfectly and the wine pairing was perfect. \nThe service was perfect, the waitress knew every wine that was served. Each course was timed perfectly and we were never rushed and very well attended to. We were welcomed by not only the hostess and wait staff but also the sommelier and the manager. \n\nThey made our anniversary very special!","7597":"I love this location, compared to the others in the city. The girls at the window recognize me and put up with my confused post-Starbucks ordering (it's like learning a new language).  I like that. \n\nI have to admit that spikey haired guy once threw my frosted donut in a bag with my son's munchkins causing them to become glued together with chocolate frosting. Not ideal, but for the people who are okay with their food touching, probably not an issue.   \n\nThere is a angsty kid who seriously made my latte out of chocolate syrup, coffee AND espresso one time. But as soon as I checked out of rehab for my new caffeine addiction, they gave me a new drink, a full punch card and gave that kid a lesson in making the coffees. Win win!","4211":"Handy Manny was great! He came out same day and installed a new kitchen faucet. Price was reasonable. I Highly recommend him.","3533":"I took my Infiniti FX35 to AZ Automasters to get it ready for a 5-day 1,600-mile road trip from Phoenix, AZ to Yosemite National Park and back.  My car had 130,000 miles at the time.\n\nAZ Automasters performed all necessary maintenance and I had zero issues during my trip.  My car performed perfectly up and down mountains with 3 occupants and plenty of cargo.\n\nI am extremely happy with the service at AZ Automasters and recommend it wholeheartedly.  Thank you!!!","1804":"Amazing food and service. \n\nThe only negative is that on the weekends it is so busy that they want you to eat fast and go! so they can sit the other people.... \n\nbut i guess it's a business and thats how it works. \n\nI would still highly recommend it!","4186":"I love this place! Went for a date with my BF. We had half a bottle of red wine, caprese salad, two entrees, and a desert for $50. The ambiance was great. The service was ...well they are super busy..so good under circumstances. Like others have said is simple but super tasty and for a cheap date night its perfect!","3959":"I have been going to Kylie once a month for a year now and she is fantastic! I have thin dark hair and she bleaches it to a light blonde every time without frying my hair. My hair still shines which it has never done after highlighting. Kylie is very professional, friendly, and very talented. \n\nThe salon is beautiful. They will offer you coffee and water in the grotto where I usually wait for my hair to process. It's usually very quiet and relaxing in there. Their prices aren't too bad either. I really don't see myself jumping ship any time soon. I love this place.","7632":"The deli provided the worst service. We decided to go to another grocer. They seems uninterested in helping us this was the second time.","5059":"I loved the fact that they had a 100lb wash machine, so I packed my children up and my husband and drove from Swissvale to use this laundromat. We have a washer and dryer at home however sometimes as a mom with three babies under two I just want to get it all done and fast.\nUpon arrival the 100lb machine had clothes in it, I asked one of the very nice employees if this was a load they were washing (they offer wash and fold services) it was not I waited 20 mins during the 20 mins I and asked other customers if the clothes were theirs and they weren't. I went to an employee to ask them if I could remove the clothes that had been sitting in the washer for over 20 mins, they had no idea.\nI would've given this place a 5 star if they simply put signs up letting ppl know after your loads are completed please promptly remove your clothes especially since they only have one 100lb washer.\nAlso they have no public restroom which is very inconvenient when your washing and folding 100+lbs of laundry it just doesn't make sense. I had to spend extra money and go to Crazy Mocha to use their facilities.","6029":"Despite the long drive thru line, they were really great. Happy to be there and helpful. Super efficient too.  Keep up the positive attitude!  I can see why people come over and wait patiently.","6142":"I was so excited to try this place- unfortunately, it didn't live up to the expectation.  Don't get me wrong - it's a neat concept and the decor is kind of cool.  Service was sub-par at best.  Although we may have just had a poor server - the rest of the tables appeared happy with their service.  The beer taps weren't working because it was too warm???  Agreed it was hot out but when you're a craft beer business I would think that might be something you consider in Phoenix AZ.  The food was ok - interesting and certainly fresh.  We had a mushroom flatbread that was way too heavy in truffle oil and arugula and way too light in mushrooms while the crust was tasteless.  The roasted chicken was - well, weak at best.  Over cooked and tough.  \n\nThe concept certainly is interesting but I won't be back.  It pales to any other farm to table restaurants I've eaten at.  And the craft selection even if working was poor.","4457":"Fawn went to pink lotus in gilbert \nLibby went to polish me pretty in Tempe\nLots of changes at pink polish","8728":"Love this joint. One of the best diamonds in the roughness of Sin City. Real people, real good drinks. Check it out if you haven't. Karaoke Friday and Saturday nights 10-2!!!","4965":"GMT has been the best medical transportation service !!! being a nurse for years i have dealt with several medical transport services, and by far GMT has been the best in LAS VEGAS !!!! I want to say thank you to Maria the dispatcher for all your help, you are always professional, helpful, and very patient on the phone with my elderly friend ,  you are awesome and have provided the best customer service, you are a great asset to GMT, I also want to give a shout out to Steven, transport driver, thank you for always giving the best care to my elderly friend, and having patience and kindness, your professional, and hard working, thank you to Cameron who recently moved  on to another job, but  was always helpful, professional, and awesome , and thank you to Gustavo for your help and great customer , both Steven and Gustavo provide excellent customer service with my elderly friend, which Steven has transported several times to appointments and transfers him from the bed to wheel chairs, thank you so much !!! I highly Recommend GMT transport to everyone , the Best !!!!","6292":"Overall, a great place to eat.  However, the one negative on JT Walkers is they serve THE WEAKEST mixed drinks we have ever had.  I seriously wonder if they even put alcohol in them.  We have experienced this on numerous occasions, both in the main dining room and upstairs with a number of different bartenders.  Its discouraging to pay $6+ for a drink and get syrup and flavored fillers.  On the positive side, they have expanded their craft beer selection and have a very nice selection both draft and bottle.  They also have a great appetizer selection and all are excellent.  Their entree selection is fair and needs rotated.  However, we have been pleased with the quality and quantity of food we have had.  If JT would take a lesson from Boltini's and serve a quality mixed drink he would deserve a 5-star rating.","4623":"I love the happy hour specials. It has pizza, wings, garlic noodles, sliders, etc... What more do you need to go with a couple beers? I usually come here specifically for the happy hour specials but a few times I've dined here with some friends. The jambalaya is my favorite off their menu. Really good.Gets really busy on the weekends.","8807":"Was told cab would come within 5-10 min, 15 minutes later, a mini van came! I don't know how that'll impact the price but I'm pretty sure it's more expensive than regular cab. I was late for work so I told the drive to go a bit faster, then he started talking on phone throughout the trip, and guess what, he was even slower than other cars on highway! Would never call from there again!","2238":"I used to love Scramble, but they have taken their rosemary potatoes off their menu which was a primary item I personally loved and made them different from other breakfast places. It's now IHOP type food. Their eggs are very bland as well, Scramble has definitely changed.","5973":"Really I came in with the word partner for Veterans Day being a vet hurricane real gave me a free entree and non-alcoholic beverage and I love the wings the sauce was delicious the wings were large.  Really enjoyed the service and how they treated us vets. I will  be back!","1549":"We held and catered our Salvador Family Reunion in July 2017.  Pamela Eddy and their Catering Team did a fabulous job!  We were able to change our buffet menu at the last moment due to their special offering of a pasta menu.  OMG - the entire family was pleasantly surprised and completely satiated by the shrimp, meatballs, chicken, salad and dessert bites throughout the evening!  We had issues with our own (personal) projector, and their Equipment Team went completely out of their way to troubleshoot our cable connectors, even lending us their adapter!  The Orleans Catering\/Event Team really helped to keep my hosting stress (to a minimum), and actually enjoy time with all.  The Family also liked the convenience of the free shuttle to the Strip\/Linq alley, movie theatre, bowling alley, free parking, onsite restaurants\/lounges and reasonably priced gaming tables.  All around great option for family gatherings, but with easy access to strip for grown-ups!","1999":"On Nov 13 2012, about 4:30 PM after a long day we decide to stop to this restaurant to have a meal. We heard about it from a german friend of us. The restaurant was empty and just some employees staying in a corner and chating in german language. They welcome us and after we exchanged some words about how we heard about the place we placed the order. Chicken snitzel with spaetzel for me and red cabbage with sausages for my fiance. The snitzel was very oily and this is a very good reason for me to don't eat there again. But the real reason was the long hair I found in the spatzel after I completed more than half of portion. This is a big issue for a restaurant. Probably they don't meet the basic standards in the kitchen. I tried to calm myself and don't do a scene in the restaurant in the front of my fiance. We were very embarrassed about this, we were totally shocked because it was the first time when this happened to us. I understand the accidents might happen but if as cook you cover your hair during the work this can prevent all this kind of stuffs. After we paid the bill and tipped I decided to tell to the host what happened. I can't remember any apologies came from that lady. It was the first and last time when we stepped into that place. I will make sure my friends won't ever go there. That's the way it supposed to work.","3935":"Staff was very friendly and welcoming! Their hand wash and detail was great and left the car looking clean and shiny. The whole thing took less than 20 minutes around 9:15am. Also, their prices are competitive and definitely worth it. I will be going back here when my car needs a wash.","7443":"I had the chicken sandwich, it was surprisingly bland, and a little dry. My sister had a salad that wasn't great. I was with a whole table full of family and all were underwhelmed.  I had heard that is was so great... I would say, ehhh.","3859":"ATHLETE'S FOOT - Recently moved to Aurora & was looking for a regular nail place.  Found this place on google, called and made an appointment.  Went in with my husband for pedicures.  They were nice enough.  The lady doing my husband's pedicure did not understand ONE word spoken to her and was super slow.  By the time my lady was done half of my pedicure, the other lady was just on his 3rd or 4th nail.  Not a bid deal, since I figured there will be enough time by the time I'm done. She started shaping my husbands nails, he kept saying no can you please just keep my nail the way it is, I don't want it shaped, but she kept looking at him and cutting it shorter and shorter.  He was so frustrated that the owner noticed, came over & took over to try to fix his nail, but it was too late and they were cut really short (some of his nails grew into his skin after cause they were so short) Up to this point I wouldn't have written a review, cause the owner was trying to be super nice to make up for the screw up and was chatting with us.  I'm not too picky so I wasn't planning on writing anything to complain.  Whatever it was done and done & we figure we won't be going back there again since it's not worth it.  But then came the Athlete's foot.  I've been getting pedicures for the last 10-15 years and never have I caught anything from a pedicure.  I am sooooo angry.  It took so long for it to go away (after buying over the counter stuff, and then going to a doctor).  I'm sure it was from this place because I didn't do anything else (like swimming, or going to gym) that would cause it.  My husband didn't get it, so I guess it's a 50\/50 gamble.  I would NEVER EVER step foot in this place again.  Do yourself a favor and don't take the risk.","6402":"Amazing service , cocktails , and food is to die for... Pig ear pad Thai WOW!!  BRISKET WOW!! Oxtail tortellini. WOW!! My new favorite place in Phoenix","853":"Had the pleasure to meet Jason and we new his\nChef Rico and Bobbi one of his Day bartenders from before. Awesome place with great ambiance and a super daily happy hour.  Two thumbs up.","7217":"Do NOT eat here!!!!! We went to Zushi on Thursday 7\/13 for happy hour. We've been there before and usually order the same items. Today we ordered our usual the Mesa role which doesn't include avocado and I told the waitress I was allergic to avocado and I wrote it on the sushi order sheet to be safe. When we got our rolls, I ate one and immediately realized that it had avocado in it. I started having an allergic reaction almost immediately and had to rush to the bathroom (which was filthy). After having my tongue and throat swell up we requested to speak to the manager, we watched him serve 6-7 more drinks at the bar until we asked the waitress again to get him. Once he finally came over and we explained the situation, he said oh well mistakes happen, he was blatantly disrespectful, and basically laughed in my face (well THAT IS ONE DEADLY MISTAKE dealing with people's allergies). We asked for an incident report (for documentation) and he said he would go write one up then returned 15 minutes later and said he's never heard of an incident report. THEN they tried to make us pay for our meal that did not get eaten. Needless to say THE WORST food experience and customer service experience of my entire life.","437":"I finally had a chance to make it to Conflict Kitchen before they move at the end of the month to the Strip District. I loved it. We had the broiled yuca and the slow cooked pork. Both platters come with rice and beans and a cabbage salad. The food was delicious and it was very interesting to read about Cuba on the food packaging.","1603":"Soooo good!  Love the pesto and vodka sauce.  You can really tell the noodles are homemade!","4759":"The perfect joint to bring a book (Or a comic book) and enjoy a coffee on a cold winter day. Although the atmosphere is perfect, the coffee could be better","540":"I really loved this place. There are so many ways to customize a taco here that I can't see how it would get old. The best part is the hard shell taco inside the soft shell and you won't leave here still hungry or broke like some other trendy spots. I will definitely be back","6200":"We had Martin & Sons come over and install a UV light and humidifier in our house air system. The difference in air quality is incredible. The team was polite, knowledgeable, and did a fantastic job.
